authors,"Authors of the original publication, as downloaded from either Web of Science or Scopus. Note, non-standard english characters were modified when identifying duplicates to ensure matches."
year,"Year of the original publication, as downloaded from either Web of Science or Scopus"
title,"Title of the original publication, as downloaded from either Web of Science or Scopus"
doi,"DOI of the original publication, as downloaded from either Web of Science or Scopus. Blanks or NA values are due to no DOI being recorded for the publication on the database it was downloaded from."
kingdom,"Taxonomic Kingdom, coded by Blois et al. (2024). The 'ecosystem' value indicates instances where multiple taxa across kingdoms were included in a study. NA indicates papers where Kingdom was not captured."
taxa_res_modelled,"The taxonomic level at which ecological niche modeling was performed, coded by Blois et al. (2024). The 'undefined' values indicate that the taxonomic level was not coded by the publications authors."
num_taxa,"The number of taxa that were modeled in the paper, coded by Blois et al. (2024) at the taxonomic resolution they conducted modelling at. NA indicates that the number of taxa was not clearly indicated by the publications authors."
time_modelled,The date relative to the year 2000 which the authors created ecological or paleoecological niche models for - these were defined by the mean age of the occurrence points the authors used. Negative values indicate that the model was developed in times before the present. 
time_projected,The date relative to the year 2000 which the authors projected ecological or paleoecological niche models to - these were defined by the date of the environmental predictors the authors used. The negative values indicate that the model was projected to a time before the present. Positive values indicate that the model was projected to a time subsequent to 2000.
time_integrated,TRUE indicates niche models were trained/calibrated using occurrences from multiple time periods. FALSE indicates niche models were developed using occurrences from a single time periods.
fossil_modelling,TRUE indicates niche models were trained/calibrated using fossil occurrences. FALSE indicates niche models were developed using only contemporary occurrences.
fossil_validation,TRUE indicates niche models were validated using fossil occurrences. FALSE indicates niche models were not validated using fossil occurrences.
additional_evidence_integration,TRUE indicates that some other tool or method in addition to niche modeling was used in the paper. FALSE indicates that the paper solely relied on niche modeling methods.
additional_evidence,Freeform comment describing the type of additional evidence that was provided. NA's were generally used when the 'additional_evidence_integration' column = FALSE to indicate a true absence of alternative methods.
geographic_scale,"The geographic scale at which the publications authors niche models were developed at, as coded by Blois et al. (2024). Global indicated the study spanned the majority of Earth. Cross-continental was used for studies which spanned more than one continent (e.g., Europe and North America). Continental indicated that a study spanned the vast majority of a single continent. Regional scale studies encompassed a large region within a continent, commonly designated by geo-political bounderies. Local studies were typically conducted at relatively small extents that did not span an entire region."
