In this study, a complex characterization of the environments once occupied by these hominins in Western Eurasia were performed. It included the determination of the biome and climatic zones occupied, the potential wind exposures, the classification of the karst regions where they lived, the direction of the entrance of caves inhabited and the average daily total solar irradiation values. In addition, the climatic suitability of the Mediterranean mosquito fauna, tick-borne encephalitis and four large mammal species as potential mammal hosts were also studied. It was found that Western Eurasian hominins occupied a wide ecological niche range from the semi-arid to the subarctic climates. Between the MIS20-MIS4 interval, the biomes occupied by Neanderthals and their ancestors shifted from the woodland-shrubland to the boreal biomes, indicating the increasing general biocultural adaptation to the more continental environments. These populations inhabited territories with weak to moderate wind exposure (Beaufort 2–5) and usually occupied caves with a south or southwest-oriented entrance. This habitat selection indicates the recognition of local microclimatic factors and a conscious choice of shelters. In the glacial periods, the increasing extension of temperate-subpolar karst regions at the expense of the more habitable subtropical karst areas might have adversely affected the overwintering chances of ancient western Eurasian populations in West, Central Europe, and Central Asia. The supraorbital area of ancient hominins with low receding foreheads and prominent supraorbital ridges may have been exposed to a greater risk of the development of frontal sinusitis and its complications than modern humans with more gracile skulls. Neanderthals and their predecessors were exposed to moderate average daily solar radiation values, although these values exhibit heterogenic picture in the comparison of Central and Southern Europe. While the southern European Neanderthal populations were dominantly exposed to the risk of mosquito-borne diseases, the northern and central populations could suffer from tick-borne diseases. However, both tick-borne encephalitis virus and its medium-large mammal hosts were present in most sites dwelled by Neanderthals and their ancestors. © 2023 The Author",Adaptation; Environmental factors; Palaeolithic; Paleoecology,Caves; Ecology; Solar radiation; Viruses; Adaptation; Ecological niche; Environmental factors; Exposed to; Hominins; Karst regions; Large mammals; Neanderthals; Palaeoecology; Paleolithic; Mammals; adaptation; environmental factor; habitat selection; hominid; karst; microclimate; morphology; Neanderthal; overwintering; paleoecology; Paleolithic; subtropical region; Beaufort; Central Asia; Central Europe; Eurasia; North Carolina; Southern Europe; United States,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159475312,,TRUE,?

The paucity of direct radiocarbon dates and poor preservation of organic remains makes it difficult to track the origins, spread and intensity of food production in this part of the world. Nevertheless, the prevailing narrative in North African prehistory is that cattle pastoralism was the defining characteristic of mid-Holocene African economies, against a backdrop of widespread aridification. Here we present the first ever trans-Saharan analysis of mid Holocene subsistence behaviour using a novel comparative analysis of zooarchaeological remains, organic residue analysis from pottery and palaeohydrological mapping. In some areas, domestic animal resources appear to have played only a marginal role in economic practices, which were typically diverse and potentially even specialised as a response to local environmental conditions. We utilise organic residue analysis (ORA) from 478 potsherds in conjunction with zooarchaeological data to examine animal resource exploitation strategies and environmental change. We demonstrate a significant increase in the δ13C value of the C16:0 fatty acid through time, reflecting a substantial increase in C4 vegetation associated with increased aridity. However, despite the changing environmental conditions, North Africa offered a unique context for Neolithic developments. Lakes that persisted during the onset of Saharan aridification provided highly productive and sustainable ecological niches that supported the resilience of hunter-gatherer fisherfolk. Analysis of site distance to water and faunal exploitation strategies reveals a significant correlation between aquatic resource strategies and proximity to water. As such, we propose that rather than being a wave of expansion, as has often been suggested, cattle pastoralism in the Sahara happened as a sporadic expansion, with mid-Holocene populations adapting and specialising in the context of habitat fragmentation and increasing environmental diversity. © 2023",Faunal remains; Isotopes; Neolithic; Organic residue analysis; Palaeohydrology; Pastoralism; Sahara,Animals; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Faunal remain; Habitat fragmentation; Holocenes; Neolithic; Organic residue analyse; Organic residues; Palaeohydrology; Pastoralism; Residue analysis; Sahara; Expansion; aridification; cattle; exploitation; food production; habitat fragmentation; Holocene; hunter-gatherer; hunting; Neolithic; pastoralism; Africa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153567122,,FALSE,

This calls for concerted efforts for developing renewable energy technologies (RETs). In this regard, the current paper examines the historical development of the solar photovoltaic (PV) niche formation in Iran from 1990 to 2020 in two chronological phases, i.e., technological niches and market niches. We adopt strategic niche management framework and highlight the active role of government support should plays as a key prerequisite required for RET niches development in oil-rich developing countries (ORDCs) where market is heavily in favor of fossil sources of energy. Data was gathered through 19 semi-structured interviews as well as PV-related science and technology development activities. We found that while universities and research institutions played a pivotal role in PV technological niche formation, foreign direct investment (FDI) and local firms were instrumental in PV market niche development. Our findings provide recommendations to direct ORDCs in developing PV, which include proper implementation of feed-in tariff policy, enhanced collaboration among international and local actors, integrated and balanced development of the PV value chain, diversified application of PV in the residential and industrial sectors, and lastly, leveraging FDI and joint-ventures as means of promoting local technological capabilities, industrialization, and market expansion. © 2023 International Energy Initiative",Government support; Iran; Market niche; Oil-Rich developing countries; Solar photovoltaic system; Strategic Niche Management; Technological niche,Commerce; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Government supports; Iran; Market niche; Oil-rich developing country; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy technologies; Solar photovoltaic system; Solar photovoltaics; Strategic niche management; Technological niche; Developing countries; alternative energy; developing world; industrialization; photovoltaic system; policy implementation; solar power; tariff structure; Iran,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150066033,,FALSE,

An analysis was carried out using a detailed material, energy, and economic inventory based on a commercial food processing plant located in northeast Spain. The environmental sustainability was determined using process-based environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA), applying a cradle-to-market approach, and using the EF3.0 impact assessment methodology to quantify impacts on five midpoint categories (climate change, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, freshwater eutrophication, and fossil resource use) and an aggregated single score. Additionally, an environmental life cycle costing (E-LCC) was performed. The pre-cooked vegetable products showed a higher environmental footprint than the fresh-cut products in all the impact categories (between 14.0 % and 39.9 %) and involved higher life cycle costs (15.2 %), due to the increased demand for ingredients, packaging materials, and electricity consumption per FU (kg of product). The carbon footprint (CF) and the cost for the fresh-cut products were 0.72 kg CO2 eq/kg and 2.62 €/kg, respectively, compared to 0.86 kg CO2/kg and 3.02 €/kg for the pre-cooked vegetables. The environmental profiles of both products were rather similar, with a dominance of the Upstream stage (production of ingredients and packaging materials), followed by the Core stage (mainly due to electricity consumed during vegetable processing). The relevance of the Core stage is amplified in the economic analysis due to the incorporation of certain processes which were not included in the process-based E-LCA (e.g., labour, capital, insurance, maintenance costs, etc.). To integrate the economic and environmental analyses, an eco-efficiency index was calculated that describes the carbon emissions per unit of monetary cost, resulting in 0.27 kg CO2eq/€ for the fresh-cut and 0.28 kg CO2 eq/€ for the pre-cooked vegetables. © 2023",Carbon footprint; Cradle-to-market; Eco-efficiency; Environmental life cycle costing; Life cycle assessment; Ready to eat,Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Eutrophication; Packaging materials; Sustainable development; Vegetables; Cradle-to-market; Eco-efficiency; Economic sustainability; Environmental life cycle; Environmental life cycle costing; Environmental sustainability; Fresh-cut; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Ready-to-eat; Life cycle; carbon; fresh water; ozone; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; economic analysis; food product; life cycle analysis; sustainability; vegetable; acidification; advertising; Article; capital; carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; convenience food; cradle to market; economic development; economic efficiency; economic sustainability; electricity; environmental economics; environmental life cycle costing; environmental sustainability; eutrophication; food industry; food processing; fossil; fresh cut vegetable; insurance; labor; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; photochemistry; pre cooked vegetable; Spain; vegetable; food handling; procedures; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Food Handling; Vegetables,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147995375,,FALSE,

Since the beginning of the Holocene (∼11.4 kyr BP), the distribution of forests has not occurred uniformly, resulting in diverse types of vegetation landscapes. In this study, we used a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to obtain the ecological niche model (ENM) of two sub-Mediterranean oak species, Quercus pubescens Willd. (pubescent oak) and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex (holm oak), both in the present day in the Iberian Peninsula and within a Middle Holocene (8.2–4.2 kyr BP) climatic scenario in the NE Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, we used the locations of Neolithic archaeological sites containing anthracological data to analyze the relationship between human occupations and oak habitats. Our results suggest that the two oaks have responded differently to the climatic conditions that have occurred, and show changes in both potential distributions. The palaeolandscape vegetation map shows a denser vegetation cover in the lowlands and a more open landscape in the highlands, with a higher dominance of Quercus pubescens in the septentrional areas, while Quercus ilex was more restricted to certain coastal areas. Temperature and precipitation factors, mainly seasonal climatic conditions, have had a greater impact on the distribution of vegetation than other factors. We found a good overlap between the ENM of the two oaks and the locations of the Neolithic sites analysed, and determined that the distribution of Neolithic archaeological sites is not random. The Neolithic populations in the study area depended heavily on the resources of the deciduous and evergreen sub- Mediterranean forest, although they also exploited the resources of the mountain pine forest. Neolithic sites distribution suggests that Neolithic human groups were aware of the potential of forests and probably gathered woody resources in their surroundings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Anthracology; Climate change; Maximum entropy model; Mediterranean oaks; Neolithic populations,biodiversity; climate change; climate conditions; coniferous forest; deciduous tree; environmental factor; Holocene; Neolithic; seasonal variation; vegetation cover; Iberian Peninsula; Mediterranean Sea,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146572779,,TRUE,

Here, we examine regional-scale ecological changes resulting from a Late Devonian mass extinction event using brachiopod fossil assemblages from the Appalachian Basin. About half of the species went extinct, but were largely replaced by new immigrant taxa. Both before and after the extinction, the primary gradient in faunal composition was correlated with onshore-offshore position, with a second gradient attributed to frequency of disturbance. Survivors of the extinction displayed a strong degree of niche conservatism along these gradients. Despite these indicators of ecological stability, the pre- and post-extinction faunas were quite distinct at the order level, with atrypids and strophomenids largely replaced by productids, whose spiny shells may have provided greater resistance to disturbance and/or predation. Thus, extinction survivors persisted in similar ecological niches despite environmental perturbations and considerable change in the taxonomic and ecological composition of the regional species pool. © 2023 The Author(s).",Appalachian Basin; brachiopod; ecological gradient; Kellwasser events; palaeoecology,"brachiopod; Devonian; ecological impact; environmental disturbance; environmental gradient; fossil assemblage; mass extinction; niche partitioning; paleoecology; taxonomy; Appalachian Basin; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; evolution; fossil; invertebrate; species extinction; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Fossils; Invertebrates",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151779735,,FALSE,

Three subspecies are recognized currently within M. temama using pelage coloration as the primary diagnostic character. However, it remains unclear if there is any pattern of morphological variation throughout its distribution. We compared two models of morphological subdivision, namely the traditional subspecies and another based on biogeographic provinces via 2D geometric morphometrics and ecological niche modeling. The second model presented a better fit to the observed variation in cranial shape and size. We found divergence in skull size between individuals from Mexico and Guatemala (northern group) relative to specimens from Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama (southern group), the latter being 8% larger than the northern group. Centroid size showed a significant correlation with geographic distance suggesting an isolation-by-distance pattern. Low geographical overlap between the two clusters suggests niche conservatism. Late Pleistocene dispersal from South to Central America and differences in available resources with subsequent isolation due to climatic barriers therefore may have promoted differentiation in size albeit without extensive changes in shape. In this context, the Motagua-Polochic-Jolotán fault system probably plays a key role in promoting morphological differentiation by climatic isolation. Finally, we suggest that M. t. temama (Kerr, 1792) and M. t. reperticia Goldman, 1913 should remain as valid names for the two morphological and ecologically differentiated groups detected here. © The Author(s) 2022.

However, the degradation performance of commercially available BDP products in real soils and the response of soil microbial communities to biodegradation remain unclear. Here, we explored the degradation characteristics of a commercial BDP product (made from starch, polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT)) in different soils in a microcosm system over a period of 360 days. Temporal dynamics of associated bacterial communities in different soil niches (control soil, plastic surface soil and bulk soil (soil without close contact with plastics)) were profiled. Weight loss reached 42.0±1.2% to 48.0±2.2% in different soils after 360 days. The degradation of BDP followed the same pattern in different soils characterized by two distinct stages. In the first stage (day 0–30), BDPs experienced major weight loss (35.8–41.9%) which coincided with a drastic increase in the soil dissolve organic carbon (1.53–2.25 times the control soil) and the forming of distinct bacterial communities in the plastic surface soil. Thermalgravimetric analysis (TGA) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed the fast depletion of starch in this stage. In addition, observations with naked eyes and scanning electron microscope confirmed intensive microbial colonization on BDP surfaces. In the second stage (day 30–360), the degradation of remaining PLA and PBAT continued at a relatively slow rate. Meanwhile bacterial communities in the plastic surface soil started to gradually recover from the disturbance caused by fast biodegradation in the first stage in a soil-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that the degradation performance of BDPs was limited by the degradation rate of relatively recalcitrant components and the temporal dynamics of associated soil bacterial communities synchronized with the degradation of BDPs. © 2022",Biodegradable plastics; Biodegradation; DOC; Plastisphere; Soil bacterial community,Agriculture; Bacteria; Biodegradable polymers; Degradation; Dynamics; Elastomers; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Organic carbon; Scanning electron microscopy; Soils; Starch; Thermogravimetric analysis; Bacterial community; Biodegradable plastics; Different soils; DOC; Performance; Plastic surfaces; Plastisphere; Soil bacterial community; Surface soil; Temporal dynamics; Biodegradation; biodegradable plastic; organic carbon; polylactic acid; plastic; polyester; starch; bacterium; biodegradation; dissolved organic carbon; microbial community; plastic; soil microorganism; temporal variation; Actinobacteria; Article; biodegradation; controlled study; DNA extraction; Firmicutes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; microbial community; microcosm; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; Rhizobium; scanning electron microscopy; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil texture; Streptomyces; surface property; surface soil; thermogravimetry; ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry; agriculture; bacterium; soil; Agriculture; Bacteria; Biodegradable Plastics; Plastics; Polyesters; Soil; Starch,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145240468,,FALSE,

However, many of the available pollen records for this period are of low resolution or fragmented, limiting our understanding of millennial-scale climatic variability. We present a high-temporal resolution pollen record that encompasses the period between MIS 12 and MIS 10 (434–356 ka BP), recovered from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 976 in the Alboran Sea. This study aims to provide new insights into the response of vegetation during the transition and to highlight patterns of climatic variability during MIS 11. The ODP Site 976 pollen record shows the shift from glacial to interglacial at 426 ka BP, highlighted by the transition from Pinus, herbaceous and steppic taxa to temperate and Mediterranean taxa. A climatic optimum for temperate and Mediterranean taxa is identified around 426–400 ka BP, equivalent to substage MIS 11c and synchronous with the maxima in SSTs, greenhouse gas concentrations and insolation. A phase with increased Pinus and Cedrus indicates the return to colder and more arid conditions during substage MIS 11b (400–390 ka BP). Substage MIS 11a (390–367 ka BP) is marked by a period of short-term warming followed by gradual cooling, until the return of glacial conditions during MIS 10. Forest contractions have been linked with high- and moderate-intensity climate events also observed in other pollen records and proxies from the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. Our results confirm the intense shift during the MIS 12/11 transition and show that this region is sensitive to millennial-scale climatic variation during MIS 11. The forest contractions observed in our record during events of millennial-scale variability appear to be less intense than in the central and eastern Mediterranean. This suggests that the southwestern Mediterranean may have been less variable during periods of climatic deterioration, thereby representing a possible ecological niche for vegetation. This may have provided a source of subsistence for hominins during harsher conditions, thus contributing to their demographic expansion and technological innovations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; Long-term vegetation change; Marine record; Middle Pleistocene; Millennial-scale climate variability; Pollen; Southwestern Mediterranean; Vegetation dynamics,Deterioration; Forestry; Glacial geology; Greenhouse gases; Oceanography; Vegetation; Climate variability; Long-term vegetation change; Marine isotope stages; Marine record; Middle Pleistocene; Millennial-scale climate variability; Pollen; Southwestern mediterranean; Vegetation change; Vegetation dynamics; Climate change; climate change; climate variation; glacial-interglacial cycle; greenhouse gas; hominid; marine isotope stage; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; pollen; vegetation dynamics; Alboran Sea; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Mediterranean Sea,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148537388,,FALSE,

Genetics, bioinformatics, biostatistics and geology are four diverse and broad scientific disciplines. But we believe that these can offer important insights into species distribution and evolution, if integrated. This perspective is grounded on a case study of the family Salvadoraceae, where species distribution and phylogeny show high correlation with the geological records. The results obtained from published and ongoing research indicate that we are pointing toward better visualizing the overlapping boundaries of these specific disciplines, which will be able to more accurately answer key evolutionary questions. We highlight: (1) the combined application of bedrock-soil geological data and bioinformatics to resolve evolutionary questions regarding species eco-distribution, niche prediction and bio-evolution; and (2) signifies the importance of relaxing boundaries between the disciplines to come to a better conclusion on species diversity and distribution-driven controls. Overall, we express and briefly explain our hypothesis to integrate modern analytical tools, viz., statistical correlation of geological data via. geo-statistics (Geo), and spatiotemporal biostatistics via. geo-informatics (Geo), with gene-based paleontological shreds of evidence, and sequence-based bioinformatics, to devise a practical analysis tool, namely “Geo2 gene-bioinformatics”. We invoke the development of algorithms through computational-based programs that can provide useful correlations to understand evolutionary systematics and phylogeny, species distribution, and niche prediction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.",Ecological niche; Evolutionary sciences; Geo2 gene-bioinformatics; Geographical realm; Geological evidence; Species prediction mapping,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150271674,,FALSE,?

SDMs are implemented by several different algorithms. Unfortunately, these algorithms consistently lose accuracy exactly when they are needed the most, that is with rare species, originating the so-called rare-species modelling paradox. Although approaches exist to tackle this problem, most notably by performing and then averaging a number of bivariate models, they are usually computationally intensive and were never shown to apply successfully to the rarest species (i.e. with less than 20 geographical occurrences). Here, we present a new algorithm, ENphylo, embedded in the readily-available R package RRdtn, which couples Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and phylogenetic imputation to model the distribution of rare species. Using the fossil record of 31 species of large mammals that lived during the late Pleistocene as the source data to sample from, we demonstrate ENphylo provides good SDM evaluation scores, with area under the curve and Sørensen Index both consistently above 0.75, True Skills Statistics above 0.4 and Boyce Index above 0.5 in most cases, when just 10 fossil occurrences are randomly drawn from their respective fossil records. ENphylo proved significantly more accurate than ENFA and the ensemble of bivariate models using Maxent, Generalized Linear Model and Random Forest algorithms. Intriguingly, we found that randomly drawing as little as 10 occurrence data points per species allows ENphylo to perform equally well as Maxent run using the entire fossil record of these same species and data. ENphylo provides a fast and accurate solution to perform species distribution modelling with rare species, which will help predicting their distribution in the light of climate change, and to delineate how rare extinct species reacted to past climatic variation. © 2023 The Authors.

Empirical studies have shown the southernmost (rear-edge), fragmented populations of Japanese woody plants can harbour high genetic diversity owing to their origin in southern glacial refugia. The effect of Holocene climate warming on rear-edge populations has, however, rarely been demonstrated. We assessed whether the genetic structure of populations of temperate plants in Japan can be interpreted to show legacies of both icy (Last Glacial Maximum, LGM) and warm (Holocene) climates. Location: Japanese Archipelago. Taxon: Hemerocallis middendorffii (Asphodelaceae). Methods: Population genetic profiles of 737 individuals from 41 populations were analysed to examine population structure and past population demography, using 12 EST-SSR markers. Present and past suitable habitat areas during the LGM and the Holocene climatic optimum were estimated by ecological niche modelling (ENM). Reconstructed palaeodistribution was combined with population genetics to statistically predict population demographics in relation to past climate changes. Results: Genetic analysis of the 41 populations revealed 6 regional population groups. Four groups widely dominating the northern–central ranges harboured high genetic diversity, whereas genetic divergence within the groups was low. In contrast, the two groups at the southwestern edge were geographically and genetically isolated, and they showed the lowest genetic diversity. The estimated palaeodistributions showed a decrease in the suitable range during the Holocene in comparison with that at the LGM, and only habitat suitability in the Holocene was able to predict the genetic diversity across the range. Main conclusions: Populations at the centre of the current distribution harbour high genetic diversity because they remained stable during both cold and warm periods. However, habitat fragmentation and population decline in relation to climate warming during the Holocene resulted in genetic isolation and impoverishment of the rear-edge populations. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Asphodelaceae; climate change; EST-SSR; genetic diversity; Phylogeography; population genetics,angiosperm; climate change; divergence; genetic isolation; genetic marker; genetic structure; habitat fragmentation; Holocene; phylogeography; population decline; population genetics; population structure; Japan,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145055418,,TRUE,

In this study, we aimed to indicate the species trends in possible distribution in the current and paleoclimate scenarios from the last glacial maximum (LGM). Methods: We revised R. domesticus distribution information and created ecological niche models (ENMs) between the current time and Pleistocene end scenarios for the study regions. Models were built and validated using Maxent, KUENM, and ENMeval packages in R and ArcMap. We considered the models' uncertainty when calculating the average model variance and using mobility-oriented parity (MOP) analyses to indicate extrapolation risk areas in transfer scenarios. Results: We found 44 different geographical species records, and our current time models indicate suitable areas in coastal regions of the Atlantic and surrounding locations in higher and lower latitudes. Paleoclimate models indicate general suitability in coastal regions and change in suitability in the interior region through time. Discussion: Our revision and ENMs indicate two main points: Despite the fact that R. domesticus records are spatial and time concentrated in some coastal regions of the Atlantic Forest, species could have a broader distribution area, including regions outside the biome delimitations in northeast and southwest areas of South America. Paleodistribution models indicate species broader distribution in Atlantic Forest-related areas in LGM and northern interior regions of South America from late Pleistocene to the current times. In glaciation scenarios, continental shelf distribution was relevant and species' different connectivity routes with other biomes may be developed after LGM.

Dated between 35,000 and 37,000 cal BP, it is also among the youngest occurrence of this taxon in the Iberian Peninsula, while its last known occurrence is dated to the Neolithic period. Through a comparison with the giant deer of the northern Pyrenees, we analyzed the herbivore guilds in which this taxon was associated to understand the context in which it was able to enter the Iberian Peninsula. By comparing its diet with those of specimens from Northern Europe, we detail the ecological adaptations of this taxon in this new environment. We suggest that Megaloceros accompanied the migrations of cold-adapted species by taking advantage of the opening of corridors on both sides of the Pyrenees during the coldest periods of the Late Pleistocene. The diet of the Iberian individuals, which is oriented towards abrasive plants, suggests an adaptation to a different ecological niche than that found in Northern European individuals. The northern Iberian Peninsula may have been an extreme in the geographical expansion of M. giganteus. More specimens will be needed in the future to establish the variability of the southern Megaloceros populations. © 2023 by the authors.",biogeography; cervids; dental microwear; Late Pleistocene; linear morphometry,classification; deer; dentition; fossil record; guild; herbivore; morphometry; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; paleogeography; paleontology; Pleistocene; taxonomy; wear; Catalonia; Spain,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149119358,,FALSE,

However, the mechanisms driving high levels of species richness in a region with relatively low topographic relief and homogeneous climate are unclear. We investigated the evolutionary processes driving ancestral area evolution and diversification in a biodiversity hotspot from both a systematic and biogeographical context using a clade endemic to the hotspot. Location: North American Coastal Plain. Taxon: The Scrub Mint clade (SMC) comprises Dicerandra, Conradina, Piloblephis, Stachydeoma and four species of Clinopodium (Mentheae; Lamiaceae), almost all of which are endemic to the North American Coastal Plain. Methods: We generated a dated phylogeny using a target enrichment/capture dataset and then calculated ancestral area using biogeographical models. We uncovered neo- and palaeo-endemism hotspots and inferred ancestral potential ranges at each node based on ancestral niche reconstructions and palaeoclimatic data to understand the geographical range evolution of subclades. Results: Ancestral area for the SMC was inferred to be the Florida Panhandle/Apalachicola River basin. A diversification event likely happened around the mid-Pleistocene Transition. Endemism hotspots were recovered in NE Florida, the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, and along the Lake Wales Ridge. Reconstructions of potential ranges support biogeographical findings, with the ancestor of the SMC likely located in the vicinity of the northeastern Gulf Coast during interglacial and glacial periods. Main Conclusions: The timing of diversification events and colonization of new areas by ancestors of the SMC are consistent with the timing of major geological events in the region. The presence of multiple types of endemism highlights the complexity of evolutionary and ecological processes that foster the large number of endemic taxa found in this region. Efforts to identify hotspots in this region will be critical to preserving the remaining pockets of biodiversity threatened by global change. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",ancestral range reconstruction; CANAPE; diversification; Florida scrub; Lamiaceae; sandhill,ancestry; biodiversity; coastal plain; colonization; endemic species; endemism; evolution; glacial-interglacial cycle; phylogeny; Pleistocene; species richness; Apalachicola River; Florida Panhandle; Florida [United States]; Israeli Coastal Plain; Lake Wales Ridge; United States,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143399793,,TRUE,?

However, previous work on raptor diversity focused predominantly on taxonomic diversity. Here, we assess the global patterns of raptor taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and their association with current and historical environmental factors. Location: Global. Time period: Present day. Major taxa studied: Raptors. Methods: We compiled information from distribution maps, global trait datasets and avian phylogenies for all extant raptors. We used generalized least squares (GLS) to assess the relationship between historical and contemporary environmental predictors and species richness, phylogenetic diversity [Faith's phylogenetic diversity index (Faith's PD), mean pairwise distance (MPD) and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD)] and functional diversity of traits related to raptor morphology, lifestyles, diet, foraging and vagility, while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Results: Raptor taxonomic diversity peaked in tropical regions and nearby mountain ranges. After controlling for species richness, species-poor assemblages in high latitudes and deserts were more phylogenetically and functionally diverse than expected by chance. In species-rich assemblages, diet and foraging traits had greater variation, whereas morphological traits had less variation than expected, suggesting that species packing promoted adaptive radiation in these assemblages. Historical climate influenced phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity of morphological, foraging and diet traits, leaving a signal of evolutionary history on modern assemblages. Human footprint was also an important driver of MPD and of niche and vagility trait functional diversity, with higher phylogenetic diversity in disturbed areas and with higher functional diversity in regions with intermediate levels of disturbance. Main conclusions: Both palaeoclimate and contemporary environmental conditions are important drivers of raptor phylogenetic and functional diversity. We found large mismatches among taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, demonstrating how different processes filter lineages and species traits shaping raptor assemblages.

Here, we wanted to investigate how the mammal fauna used this habitat and which different ecological niches and microhabitats they occupied. We analyzed the carbonate fraction of dental enamel of a fossil mammal assemblage from various localities of the Pondaung Fm. in Myanmar. Bayesian niche modelling of the δ13C and δ18O values allowed us to quantify aspects of the ecological core niches occupied by these taxa, to calculate niche overlap and to use these data to infer directional competition potential in this mammal assemblage. Furthermore, comparison of different areas of the Pondaung Fm. revealed two different microhabitats whose distribution is consistent with existing vegetation models.

Here, we perform multilocus metabarcoding sequencing and palynological analysis of dietary plants of >100 coprolites (estimated to date from c. 400–1900 A.D.) and > 100 frozen scats (dating c. 1950 A.D. to present) of the critically endangered, flightless, herbivorous kākāpō (Strigops habroptilus), a species that disappeared from its natural range in Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ) after the 13th C. A.D. We identify 24 orders, 56 families and 67 native plant genera unrecorded in modern kākāpō diets (increases of 69, 108 and 75% respectively). We found that southern beeches (Nothofagaceae), which are important canopy-forming trees and not an important kākāpō food today, dominated kākāpō diets in upland (c. >900 m elevation) habitats. We also found that kākāpō frequently consumed hemiparasitic mistletoes (Loranthaceae) and the holoparasitic wood rose (Dactylanthus taylorii), taxa which are nutrient rich, and now threatened by mammalian herbivory and a paucity of dispersers and pollinators. No single dataset or gene identified all taxa in our dataset, demonstrating the value of multiproxy or multigene datasets in studies of animal diets.

However, dedicated biomass is controversial for reasons including its competition with food production or its land-use and emissions impacts. Here we examine the potential role of a land-free alternative: ancillary bioenergy (AB) from biomass sources not primarily grown for energy and without land/food/feed competition. We provide the first dataset of 2050 ancillary biomass potential using the agricultural system model SOLm, which encompasses untapped by-/co-products and detailed agricultural residues. Results show that there is a limited future potential for AB in Europe (2394-10 342 PJ, which is 3-6 times lower than other estimates including dedicated biomass). We design and investigate alternative scenarios where this bioenergy resource can be fully utilised, not utilised at all, or utilised optimally by the sector-coupled energy system model Euro-Calliope. We find that fully utilising ancillary biomass can help phase out controversial nuclear or land-intensive dedicated biomass, so might achieve higher societal acceptability. Using all ancillary biomass as a negative-emissions source at stationary bioenergy carbon capture and storage plants in a nuclear-free system provides additional climate benefits. It is also possible to leave the AB potential completely unused, which barely increases total system cost, but would preserve agricultural nutrients. We conclude that there are synergies and trade-offs among possible strategic uses of AB, which can provide guidelines for a more coherent European bioenergy strategy. Although the 2050 potential of AB is limited, our findings suggest that it could fill critical strategic niches for realising carbon-neutrality. © 2023 The Author(s).

In the Sahara Desert, palaeoclimate oscillations affected the extent of hyper-arid habitats, but it is unclear how these dynamics determined the evolution and distribution of local specialists. Herein, we assessed cryptic diversity, diversification patterns and spatial connectivity within a Sahara-widespread group of dryland-adapted lizards. Location: Sahara-Sahel ecoregions. Taxon: Acanthodactylus scutellatus species group. Methods: Inter- and intraspecific phylogenetic structure, divergence times, spatial genetic patterns and cryptic diversity were assessed using nuclear and mitochondrial loci. The effects of topography and land cover on phylogeographic structure and diversity were tested with generalized linear models. Interspecific hybridization was evaluated using 11 microsatellites across the group's major sympatry zone, predicted based on ecological niche models. Results: Species of Acanthodactylus scutellatus group exhibit Late Miocene origins, followed by extensive intraspecific divergence throughout the Pliocene. The northern Sahara worked as a major diversification hotspot, harbouring a patchwork of small-ranged, divergent lineages. These lineages are parapatric or sympatric and present concordant nuclear and mitochondrial differentiation, suggesting species status. Genetic connectivity increases in southern latitudes, with wide-ranging lineages spanning from the Red Sea to the Atlantic coast. Within these potential corridors, mountain outskirts and sand fields in the Sahara interior seemingly acted as origins for recent population expansions. Genetic diversity and connectivity are favoured by terrain roughness and soft-sand cover respectively. Three species inhabit the Atlantic Sahara sympatry zone without evidence of gene flow. Main conclusions: Overlooked species-level diversity within a major specialist group of Sahara drylands exposes the recurrent knowledge shortfalls present in hyper-arid desert environments. Humidity and sandy habitat shifts triggered potential successions of population isolation and re-connectivity, which favoured cladogenesis in northern desert regions and population expansions across southern east–west corridors. © 2022 The Authors.

This research aims to characterise chiropterans’ assemblages found in two different habitat types in Tasik Kenyir (dipterocarp forest) and Setiu (oil palm plantation). A total of 48 sampling nights were conducted within two years period from March 2017 to March 2019 which covered four sampling sites in Tasik Kenyir and four sites at Setiu. Two standard four-bank harp traps and 10 mist nets were deployed throughout the study at every site to capture bats at understory levels. This makes a total of 576 sampling efforts for both areas. Song Meter SM2bats and Echo Meter Touch from Wildlife Acoustic were used to record the echolocation of insectivorous bats. The total number of individuals and species observed were used to determine species diversity, richness, and evenness. Paleontological statistic software was used to generate the rank abundance and species accumulation curves. Bray-Curtis similarity index was used to generalise the index that represents the relative abundance of the sampling sites. A total of 835 individuals comprising 31 species from six families were captured at both study areas. Out of 835 individuals, 695 were captured within Tasik Kenyir comprising 27 species from six families (H = 2.381) while 140 individuals were captured in Setiu comprising 20 species from five families (H = 2.40). The diversity of bats in Tasik Kenyir was hypothesised to be higher than in Setiu as the habitat possess a larger undisturbed forest. However, the result showed the opposite in which no significant difference was detected from the diversity index calculated between these two areas. Detailed studies need to be conducted to determine if some areas are used as transient habitats for bats. © 2022, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

Three morphotypes of the Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri) occupy different ecoregions in western North America, which vary in climate and landcover. These morphotypes (Coastal, Interior, Rocky Mountain) differ in size, plumage coloration, and head pattern. We sampled 1080 Steller's Jays from 68 populations (plus 11 outgroups) to address three main questions using data on morphology, plumage, genetics (mtDNA, microsatellites), and ecological niches: (1) How do phenotypic and genetic traits vary within and among populations, morphotypes, and ecoregions? (2) How do population-level differences in Steller's Jays compare with other sister species pairs of North American birds? (3) What can we infer about the population history of Steller's Jays in relation to past climates, paleoecology, and niche evolution? We found substantial morphological, genetic, and ecological differentiation among morphotypes. The greatest genetic divergence separated Coastal and Interior morphotypes from the Rocky Mountain morphotype, which was associated with warmer, drier, and more open habitats. Microsatellites revealed additional structure between Coastal and Interior groups. The deep mtDNA split between Coastal/Interior and Rocky Mountain lineages of Steller's Jay (ND2 ~ 7.8%) is older than most North American avian sister species and dates to approximately 4.3 mya. Interior and Rocky Mountain morphotypes contact across a narrow zone with steep clines in traits and reduced gene flow. The distribution of the three morphotypes coincides with divergent varieties of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. Species distribution models support multiple glacial refugia for Steller's Jays. Our integrative dataset combined with extensive geographic sampling provides compelling evidence for recognizing at least two species of Steller's Jay. © 2022 The Authors.

We explore the roles of geology and ecological tolerance in the diversification of a group of wingless beetles with low dispersal potential. Location: Western Mediterranean (Iberian Peninsula and North Africa). Taxon: Darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae: Misolampus). Methods: We sequenced nine gene fragments from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in all extant Misolampus species to reconstruct their phylogeny, evaluate species boundaries and potential contact zones and estimate divergence times. We modelled species distributions for different time periods to infer ecological preferences and assess the effects of climatic changes since the last interglacial. We used a time-stratified process-based biogeographical model to estimate ancestral areas of origin and the evolution of geographical ranges. Results: The palaeoclimatic model projections show contractions of favourable areas during the last interglacial period and mid-Holocene, and wide stretches of suitable areas during the last glacial maximum. Analyses of ancestral bioclimatic preferences reveal ecological adaptations in isolated lineages within three species. The phylogeny of Misolampus is strongly supported and unveils deep divergences within the six species. Two well-supported clades were recovered, one distributed in North Africa-Balearic Islands and another in the Iberian Peninsula. The divergence between the North African and Iberian clades occurred during the early Miocene. Biogeographical analyses infer an ancestral range including the Iberian, Betic and Rifean Plates, with subsequent splits followed by dispersal events. Main conclusions: Our results favour a dual role of vicariance and dispersal in driving the historical biogeography and diversification of Misolampus since the early Miocene. We also found evidence for incipient speciation events, underscoring the role of tectonic events and adaptation to local climatic conditions in the diversification of the group. © 2022 The Authors.

Location: Siberia. Time period: Pleistocene and Holocene. Major taxa studied: Steppe bison (Bison priscus). Methods: We configured 110,000 spatially explicit population models (SEPMs) of climate–human–steppe bison interactions in Siberia, which we ran at generational time steps from 50,000 years before present. We used pattern-oriented modelling (POM) and fossil-based inferences of distribution and demographic change of steppe bison to identify which SEPMs adequately simulated important interactions between ecological processes and biological threats. These “best models” were then used to disentangle the mechanisms that were integral in the population decline and later extinction of the steppe bison in its last stronghold in Eurasia. Results: Our continuous reconstructions of the range and extinction dynamics of steppe bison were able to reconcile inferences of spatio-temporal occurrence and the timing and location of extinction in Siberia based on hundreds of radiocarbon-dated steppe bison fossils. We showed that simulating the ecological pathway to extinction for steppe bison in Siberia in the early Holocene required very specific ecological niche constraints, demographic processes and a constrained synergy of climate and human hunting dynamics during the Pleistocene–Holocene transition. Main conclusions: Ecological processes and drivers that caused ancient population declines of species can be reconstructed at high spatio-temporal resolutions using SEPMs and POM. Using this approach, we found that climatic change and hunting by humans are likely to have interacted with key ecological processes to cause the extinction of the steppe bison in its last refuge in Eurasia. © 2022 The Authors.

To fill this gap, we assessed the relative role of geologic history, environment and phenotypic trait evolution in lineage diversification of green lizards in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. Location: Eurasia and North Africa. Taxon: Green lizards (genera Timon and Lacerta). Methods: For all green lizard lineages, we characterized distributional ranges and external morphological traits across discrete biogeographical areas, occupied macro-habitats and climatic niches using environmental variables that represent average and extreme climatic conditions. To assess the contribution of geographical factors in shaping diversity patterns, we evaluated the fit of 24 biogeographical models. We used BAMM and estimated phylogenetic signal to assess the rates of lineage diversification and of phenotypic and climatic niche evolution, and to determine whether these processes occurred steadily or at specific time periods as a response to palaeogeological or palaeoclimatic events. Finally, we tested for associations between phenotypic traits and lineage diversification using trait-dependent diversification analyses (QuaSSE, ES-sim and STRAPP). Results: Biogeographical analyses favoured a dispersal–vicariance model explaining speciation patterns in green lizards, including jump dispersal and constrained dispersal by geographical distance. Lineages accumulated gradually towards the present, with minor divergence in morphological traits and conservatism of climatic niches. In contrast, in the Lacerta agilis lineage, niche evolution may have allowed expansion towards colder environments. Morphological and climatic niche evolution were uncoupled from diversification rates. Main Conclusions: Biogeographical processes largely explain the constant lineage diversification of green lizards in the Mediterranean Basin since the Miocene, followed by gradual phenotypic divergence unrelated to cladogenesis. Climatic niche conservatism promoted the accumulation of lineages within the Mediterranean, except for L. agilis, where climatic niche evolution might underpin its range spread towards higher latitudes. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",climatic niche evolution; dispersal; diversity hotspot; integrative biogeography; Lacerta; phylogenetic comparative methods; Timon,allopatry; biogeography; dispersal; divergence; evolutionary biology; lizard; niche; phenotype; phylogenetics; range expansion; speciation (biology); Eurasia; Mediterranean Sea; North Africa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139852841,,TRUE,?

Identifying these effects on lecithotrophic larval species that live in intertidal zones is particularly challenging because they are subject to environmental heterogeneity and anthropogenic events. Here, we evaluate how biotic and abiotic features in the Southwest Atlantic littoral zone can affect a high dispersal species' present and historical demography. Location: Brazilian coast, covering more than 3000 km. Taxon: Perinereis ponteni. Methods: We investigated population genetic diversity, connectivity and past dynamics using 23,300 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated using genotyping by sequencing. We tested whether environmental abiotic variables could explain the variance found in genotype frequencies using isolation-by-environment (IBE) and landscape association approaches. These data, combined with palaeodistribution simulations and oceanic circulation modelling, were used to infer species demographic history and connectivity patterns. Results: Along with high levels of connectivity detected, we found a genetic boundary in the southeastern region of Brazil around Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro), and a cline trend for some loci. The palaeodistribution simulations reveal a spatial refuge in the southeast during the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya), with the expansion of the northern region. We identified 1421 SNPs with frequencies associated with eight environmental variables, most of which were related to temperature—the main environmental factor determining IBE. Main Conclusions: Perinereis ponteni, a polychaete with high gene flow capability responds to biogeographic barriers, highlighting the importance of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping population connectivity. Furthermore, the effect of temperature indicates that future climate change and ocean warming can hugely impact this species. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",ecological niche modelling; genetic diversity; Nereididae; ocean currents; Perinereis ponteni; rocky shores,climate change; cline; connectivity; demographic history; dispersal; ecological modeling; environmental factor; intertidal environment; Last Glacial Maximum; oceanic current; polychaete; rocky shore; species diversity; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Brazil; Cabo Frio; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil],Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139686395,,TRUE,?

Here we investigated the origin of these families and unravel the conflicting family origin theories using a high resolution tree covering taxa from each zoogeographic realm from Africa to Australia. Ancestral range estimations were performed using a probabilistic approach implemented in BioGeoBEARS with subset analysis per biogeographic range [Old-World as whole, Australia–Oriental–Oceania (AOO) and Afrotropical–Madagascar–Palearctic (AMP)]. Result: Our result supports an Oriental origin for Rhinolophidae, whereas Hipposideridae originated from the Oriental and African regions in concordance with fossil evidence of both families. The fossil evidence indicates that Hipposideridae has diversified across Eurasia and the Afro-Arabian region since the Middle Eocene. Meanwhile, Rhinonycteridae (the sister family of Hipposideridae) appears to have originated from the Africa region splitting from the common ancestor with Hipposideridae in Africa. Indomalaya is the center of origin of Rhinolophidae AOO lineages, and Indomalayan + Philippines appears to be center of origin of Hipposideridae AOO lineage indicating allopatric speciation and may have involved jump-dispersal (founder-event) speciation within AOO lineage. Wallacea and the Philippines may have been used as stepping stones for dispersal towards Oceania and Australia from the Oriental region. Multiple colonization events via different routes may have occurred in the Philippines (i.e., Palawan and Wallacea) since the Late Miocene. The colonization of Rhinolophidae towards Africa from Asia coincided with the estimated time of Tethys Ocean closure around the Oligocene to Miocene (around 27 Ma), allowing species to disperse via the Arabian Peninsula. Additionally, the number of potential cryptic species in Rhinolophidae in Southeast Asia may have increased since Plio-Pleistocene and late Miocene. Conclusion: Overall, we conclude an Oriental origin for Rhinolophidae, and Oriental + African for Hipposideridae. The result demonstrates that complex historical events, in addition to species specific ecomorphology and specialization of ecological niches may shape current distributions. © 2022, The Author(s).",Ancestral range; Dispersal; Horseshoe bats; Leafnosed bats; Oriental; Zoogeography,bat; biogeography; Cenozoic; colonization; ecomorphology; history; Miocene; zoogeography; Africa; Arabian Peninsula; Australia; Philippines; Wallacea; adenosine phosphate; animal; bat; beetle; evolution; fossil; genetics; phylogeny; Adenosine Monophosphate; Animals; Biological Evolution; Chiroptera; Coleoptera; Fossils; Phylogeny,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139114842,,FALSE,

In this study, we investigated the impact of regional habitat changes as a potential indirect effect of climate change on body size evolution. Location: Europe and North America. Time period: The Neogene (~23–2 million years ago). Major taxa: Five orders of terrestrial mammals: Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Proboscidea and Primates. Methods: We compared the two continental faunas, which have exceptional fossil records of terrestrial mammals and underwent different processes of habitat transition during the Neogene. Using Bayesian multilevel regression models, we assessed the variation in the temporal dynamics of body size diversity among ecographic groups, defined by their continent of occurrence and dietary preference. Results: Model comparisons unanimously supported a combined effect of diet and continent on all metrics of body size frequency distributions, rejecting the shared energetic advantage of larger bodies in colder climates as a dominant mechanism of body size evolution. Rather, the diet-specific dynamics on each continent pinpointed an indirect effect of climate change – change in habitat availability, and thus the resource landscape as a key driver of mammalian evolution. Main conclusions: Our study highlights dietary preference as a mechanistic link between mammalian evolution and habitat transition mediating an indirect climate-change effect and demonstrates the complexity of climatic influence on biodiversity. Our findings suggest that the intensified habitat modification today likely poses a bigger threat than climate change in itself to living mammals, and perhaps all endotherms. © 2022 The Authors.

However, a main driver of such volatility – the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – occurs with semiregular periodicity. Paleoclimatic and archeological evidence indicate not only that the strength and periodicity of ENSO patterns have changed over the late-Holocene, but their impacts were likely recognized, adapted to, and perhaps capitalized upon by agriculturalists employing adaptive risk strategies. We examine relationships over the last 1.3 kyr between ENSO periodicity, ecological transitions, and archeological settlement in Peru’s Chicama Valley through a coupled paleohydroclimate and agroecology model. We reconstruct periods when ENSO-like conditions dominated past hydroclimates and present a quantitative, spatially-explicit analysis of ecological productivity during modern ENSO-positive hydroclimate conditions. We show that archeological settlement patterns are sensitive to these transformations and reflect efforts to capitalize on expanded agroecological niches.

But the problem is now of such urgency that accelerating transition pathways to net zero is of paramount importance. Which governance approach gives society the best chance of simultaneously realizing the multiple sectoral and industrial transformations that net zero entails? How can policymakers and broader societal actors accelerate these transformative processes, setting in motion transition pathways to desirable futures? In response to these interrelated questions, we survey the literature on sustainability transitions and present an approach that aims directly at radical system change. Recent Findings: Two decades of transition research has generated critical insights on accelerating transition pathways to net zero, highlighting key transformative strategies and pointing to the central role of the state, politics, and intermediaries. Summary: Transition research indicates that reaching net zero entails radically transforming essentially all sectors and industries as they are deeply entwined with the use of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gas emissions. An ambitious state in conjunction with a strong constellation of intermediary organizations can set in motion and accelerate transition pathways by actively driving niche development surrounding promising innovations, promoting the diffusion of emerging alternatives, and phasing out carbon-intensive arrangements. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Climate change; Green industrial policy; Intermediaries; Mission-oriented innovation policy; Transition pathways,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136793865,,FALSE,

Choristodera is a clade of reptiles of uncertain phylogenetic placement that have an extremely poor fossil record throughout their 150-million-year history. Yet, choristoderes survived the K-Pg event and persisted until the Miocene. Results: I describe the skulls and skeletons of two new choristoderes from a single Paleocene ecosystem in western North America that reveal the hidden Cenozoic diversity of this reptile clade. Despite their similar size, the new species deviate dramatically in morphology. Kosmodraco magnicornis gen. et sp. nov. possesses an extremely short snout and extensive cranial ornamentation. The sacrum of K. magnicornis bears enlarged muscle attachment sites and other modifications reminiscent of some giant crocodylians. In contrast, Champsosaurus norelli sp. nov. is a longirostrine species with an uninflated and ventrally divergent postorbital skull. Together with a North American choristodere previously classified in the European genus Simoedosaurus, K. magnicornis substantiates a new clade of giant, short-snouted taxa endemic to the Americas. C. norelli is found to be an early-diverging member of the genus Champsosaurus from the Cretaceous-Paleogene of the northern hemisphere. This suggests the presence of several ghost lineages of champsosaurid that crossed the K-Pg boundary. Conclusions: The new taxa greatly increase Cenozoic choristodere richness and strengthen the evidence for the existence of distinctive freshwater faunas in Paleogene Eurasia and North America, where this clade diversified to exploit newly available macropredatory niches in the aftermath of the asteroid impact. The new choristoderes also reveal the distinct ecological context in which extant freshwater predators of the Americas like alligatoroids and gars have their origins: Paleocene fluviolacustrine ecosystems in North America displayed high large predator diversity and morphological disparity relative to modern ones. © 2022, The Author(s).",Biogeography; Cenozoic; Choristodera; Ecosystem recovery; K-Pg; Phylogenetics,morphology; Paleocene; paleoenvironment; paleontology; phylogenetics; reptile; North America; fresh water; anatomy and histology; animal; ecosystem; evolution; phylogeny; reptile; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Fresh Water; Phylogeny; Reptiles,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126774915,,FALSE,

Of these biomaterials, tooth enamel is the hardest, most mineralized vertebrate tissue and therefore least likely to be affected by chemical alteration (i.e., its isotopic composition can be preserved over millions of years), making it an important and widely available archive for biologists and paleontologists. Here, we present the first combined measurements of δ13C, δ15N, and δ18O in enamel from the teeth of modern fauna (herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores) from the well-studied ecosystem of Gorongosa National Park (GNP) in central Mozambique. We use two novel methods to produce high-precision stable isotope enamel data: (i) the “oxidation-denitrification method,” which permits the measurement of mineral-bound organic nitrogen in tooth enamel (δ15Nenamel), which until now, has not been possible due to enamel’s low organic content, and (ii) the “cold trap method,” which greatly reduces the sample size required for traditional measurements of inorganic δ13Cenamel and δ18Oenamel (from ≥0.5 to ≤0.1 mg), permitting analysis of small or valuable teeth and high-resolution serial sampling of enamel. The stable isotope results for GNP fauna reveal important ecological information about the trophic level, dietary niche, and resource consumption. δ15Nenamel values clearly differentiate trophic level (i.e., carnivore δ15Nenamel values are 4.0‰ higher, on average, than herbivores), δ13Cenamel values distinguish C3 and/or C4 biomass consumption, and δ18Oenamel values reflect local meteoric water (δ18Owater) in the park. Analysis of combined carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen stable isotope data permits geochemical separation of grazers, browsers, omnivores, and carnivores according to their isotopic niche, while mixed-feeding herbivores cannot be clearly distinguished from other dietary groups. These results confirm that combined C, N, and O isotope analyses of a single aliquot of tooth enamel can be used to reconstruct diet and trophic niches. Given its resistance to chemical alteration, the analysis of these three isotopes in tooth enamel has a high potential to open new avenues of research in (paleo)ecology and paleontology.

They inhabited environments ranging from lagoons to open oceans and are represented by a wide variety of dental morphologies. Conodonts may have filled many different ecological niches and represent a significant proportion of nekton before the Devonian. Despite this, very little is known about trophic ecology of conodonts. While morphological diversity suggests a complex trophic structure within conodont communities, there is little evidence to support dietary niche partitioning among conodonts. We tested the hypothesis that individual conodont taxa occupied different trophic niches, using Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios preserved in the dental elements of assemblages from Silurian strata of Gotland, Sweden. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca have been shown to vary in vertebrate skeletal tissues depending on trophic positioning, although biological and environmental conditions can affect these ratios. Environmental influences were minimized by examining entire conodont communities from a tropical epeiric sea and by measuring strontium isotope ratios using thermal ionization mass spectrometry in the most metropolitan taxon (Ozarkodina confluens). Composition of white matter, a tissue unique to conodonts, was also analyzed using microprobe analysis, revealing significantly lower Sr concentrations than in surrounding lamellar tissue, suggesting taxon-specific histology should be considered when analyzing conodonts for geochemical data. Excluding taxa with highly variable quantities of white matter, the results show that each taxon preserves different Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios with limited overlap, indicating variation in trophic positioning.

Thermal tolerance is the intersection between organismal requirements and climate conditions which constrains modern organisms to specific locations and was likely a major control on ancient tetrapods. Here, we test the extent of controls exerted by thermal tolerance on the biogeography of 13 Late Triassic tetrapods using a mechanistic modeling program, Niche Mapper. This program accounts for heat and mass transfer into and out of organisms within microclimates. We model our 13 tetrapods in four different climates (cool and warm at low and high latitudes) using environmental conditions that are set using geochemical proxy-based general circulation models. Organismal conditions for the taxa are from proxy-based physiological values and phylogenetic bracketing. We find that thermal tolerances are a sufficient predictor for the latitudinal distribution of our 13 test taxa in the Late Triassic. Our modeled small mammaliamorph can persist at high latitudes with nocturnal activity and daytime burrowing but large pseudosuchians are excluded because they cannot seek nighttime shelter in burrows to retain elevated body temperatures.

Therefore, we focused on the group Anguimorpha to test a possible correlation between heart morphology and ecological niche with respect to phylogenetic position in Squamata with Sphenodon, Salvator, and Pogona as the outgroups. The chosen lepidosaurian species were investigated by microCT. Generally, all lepidosaurs had two well-developed atria with complete interatrial septum and one ventricle divided by ventricular septa to three different areas. The ventricles of all lepidosaurians had a compact layer and abundant trabeculae. The compact layer and trabeculae were developed in accordance with particular ecological niche of the species, the trabeculae in nocturnal animals with low metabolism, such as Sphenodon, Heloderma or Lanthanotus were more massive. On the other hand athletic animals, such as varanids or Salvator, had ventricle compartmentalization divided by three incomplete septa. A difference between varanids and Salvator was found in compact layer thickness: thicker in monitor lizards and possibly linked to their mammalian-like high blood pressure, and the level of ventricular septation. In summary: heart morphology varied among clades in connection with the ecological niche of particular species and it reflects the phylogenetic position in model clade Anguimorpha.

Quantification of the strength, density, and nature of foraging behaviors enables the investigation of how these may have changed through time. Here, we present a novel approach to explore such patterns using spatial point process analyses to quantify the scale and strength of ichnofossil spatial distributions on horizontal bedding planes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we use two samples from the terminal Ediacaran Shibantan Member in South China (between 551 and 543 Ma) and the early Cambrian Nagaur Sandstone in northwestern India (between 539 and 509 Ma). We find that ichnotaxa on both surfaces exhibited significant nonhomogeneous lateral patterns, with distinct levels of heterogeneity exhibited by different types of trace fossils. In the Shibantan, two ichnotaxa show evidence for mutual positive aggregation over a shared resource, suggesting the ability to focus on optimal resource areas. Trace fossils from the Nagaur Sandstone exhibit more sophisticated foraging behavior, with greater niche differentiation. Critically, mark correlation functions highlight significant spatial autocorrelation of trace fossil orientations, demonstrating the greater ability of these Cambrian tracemakers to focus on optimal patches. Despite potential limitations, these analyses hint at changes in the development and optimization of foraging at the Ediacaran/Cambrian transition and highlight the potential of spatial point process analysis to tease apart subtle differences in behavior in the trace fossil record. © The Author(s), 2022.",,autocorrelation; Cambrian; Ediacaran; fossil record; sandstone; trace fossil; China; India; Nagaur; Rajasthan,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141800910,,TRUE,?*

Here, we aim to integrate as fully as possible complementary methods in ecology, genomics and palaeobiology to improve the reconstruction of species biogeographical history. Location: South-western Europe. Taxon: Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae). Methods: We compiled and mapped the raw fossil data of the Cabrera vole for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Mid-Holocene (MH). Alongside, we projected the calibrated ecological niche model (ENM) of the species' current distribution for the LGM, the Younger Dryas and the MH. Complementarily, we used previously obtained Genotyping-by-Sequencing data to evaluate the demographic history and range expansion patterns of all four Evolutionarily Significant Units of the species, in an integrative framework. Results: ENM-inferred refugial areas and genomic modelling consistently supported northern Iberian glacial refugia for the Cabrera vole. This contrasted with the higher fossil abundance of the species in southern and eastern Iberia and southern France from the LGM to the MH. Our results suggest that populations in areas with high fossil abundance went extinct, and were later replaced by northern Iberian populations such that they did not contribute significantly to the current gene pool. Main conclusions: Our integrative approach indicates how the range of the Cabrera vole fluctuated in response to environmental change during and following the LGM. Despite methodological limitations, the ENM and genomic approaches produced generally congruent results. Instead, the fossil record may misrepresent the ancestral distribution of this species and should be considered cautiously for ancestral distribution reconstruction, considering that it also reflects the fossilization conditions. Overall, our study supports the idea that integrative approaches are essential to provide an accurate and well-supported picture of historical refugial areas and range dynamics. © 2022 The Authors.

These issues affect the spatial and temporal transferability of SDMs, limiting their reliability for applications such as when studying effects of past climate change on species distribution and extinctions. The integration of paleontological and neontological data for a multitemporal calibration and validation of SDMs has been suggested for improving SDMs flexibility. Here, we provide an empirical test for a multitemporal calibration, employing virtual species (i.e., with perfectly-known distributions) and comparing them directly with monotemporal SDMs (i.e., SDM calibrated in a single time layer). We used 1kyr-interval scenarios throughout the last 22 kyr BP for two ecologically different species in South America (a “hot and wet” species and a “cold and dry” species). Models with multitemporal calibration performed similarly to models with monotemporal calibration, regardless of species, sample sizes, and time frame. However, multitemporal calibration performed better when dealing with non-analogous climates among time layers. By improving the temporal SDMs transferability, multitemporal calibration opens new avenues for integrating fossil and recent occurrence data, which may substantially benefit biogeography and paleoecology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Fossil; MaxEnt; Modelling; Niche; Simulations,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137410736,,TRUE,

Its application in the fossil record relies on a thorough understanding of the isotopic composition of mammalian diets in modern ecosystems. We compiled and evaluated a global dataset of the carbon-isotope values of artiodactyl tooth enamel, supplemented by new samples, for 79 extant species. After correcting for differences in atmospheric carbon-isotope composition, body mass, and digestive physiology, we compared the inferred carbon-isotope values of ingested forage (δ13Cdiet) among seven feeding categories. The artiodactyl herbivore dietary spectrum is expressed through a wide range of δ13Cdiet values, with the most depleted mean value in frugivores and the most enriched in obligate grazers. In general, grazing species have a broader range of isotope values than browsing species, suggesting a wider dietary niche breadth. Notably, variable grazers exhibit a bimodal distribution of δ13Cdiet values, with North American and Asian taxa consuming C3 diets and African taxa consuming C4 diets, reflecting the amount of C4 vegetation in the environment. Variation in δ13Cdiet values also occurs among terrestrial ecoregions and artiodactyl clades. Grassland ecoregions differ significantly from forest ecoregions. We detected a low but significant phylogenetic signal in the mean δ13Cdiet values of extant species, with some of the oldest ruminant lineages having maintained C3 feeding and pure C4 diets being restricted to two bovid clades. Determining variation in δ13Cdiet values in different feeding categories and lineages will help refine paleoecological and paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the rich fossil record of artiodactyls.

However, the distribution of summergreen needle-leaf forest of larch (Larix Mill.) differs markedly between the continents, despite relatively similar climatic conditions. The reasons for these differences are little understood. Our aim is to identify potential triggers and drivers of the current distribution patterns by comparing species' bioclimatic niches, glacial refugia and postglacial recolonization patterns. Location: Northern hemisphere. Taxon: Species of the genus Larix (Mill.). Methods: We compare species distribution and dominance using species ranges and sites of dominance, as well as their occurrence on modelled permafrost extent, and active layer thickness (ALT). We compare the bioclimatic niches and calculate the niche overlap between species, using the same data in addition to modern climate data. We synthesize pollen, macrofossil and ancient DNA palaeo-evidence of past Larix occurrences of the last 60,000 years and track differences in distribution patterns through time. Results: Bioclimatic niches show large overlaps between Asian larch species and American Larix laricina. The distribution across various degrees of permafrost extent is distinctly different for Asian L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi compared to the other species, whereas the distribution on different depths of ALT is more similar among Asian and American species. Northern glacial refugia for Larix are only present in eastern Asia and Alaska. Main Conclusion: The dominance of summergreen larches in Asia, where evergreen conifers dominate most of the rest of the boreal forests, is dependent on the interaction of several factors which allows Asian L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi to dominate where these factors coincide. These factors include the early postglacial spread out of northern glacial refugia in the absence of competitors as well as a positive feedback mechanism between frozen ground and forest. © 2022 The Authors.

The Lower Yangtze is thought to be the origin of domesticated rice and most studies of this region to date have focused on rice domestication and cultivation within its paleoenvironmental setting. In contrast, we highlight here diverse uses of non-rice plant resources. In addition to large quantities of rice remains (carbonized grains and spikelet bases), we identify both foxtail and broomcorn millet, both AMS radiocarbon dated earlier than 5750 cal BP, demonstrating the dispersal of millet cultivation to the Lower Yangtze in the middle Neolithic, earlier than previously securely documented. While most wild species identified in macrobotanical assemblages are traditionally categorized as weeds or incidental intrusions among food residues, many can be exploited for food and medicinal purposes. By analyzing the ecological and functional implications of identified plants, we infer ecological niches of cultivation, gathering, and possible propagation of wild plants as food and medicine. Analyses of diversity and seasonality of plant resources identified show that residents of Anle created a complex seasonal sequence of temporally compatible crops, constructing niches for two crops (rice and millet) and actively structuring opportunities to exploit available wild plant resources in their immediate environment. © The Author(s) 2022.",archaeobotany; food production; millet; niche construction; rice; wild plant foods,cultivation; wild population; China,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134005715,,FALSE,

The occurrence of this species in the south-central Pampean region between 4700 and 200 ka cal BP was originally associated with some warm climatic episodes. A later hypothesis points out that P. simplex was a typical element of the Humid Pampa subregion during this period, whose distribution was retracted to the north due to the strong anthropic modifications in the area. To corroborate these hypotheses, the niche of occurrence of P. simplex was calculated to analyse the preferred climatic conditions of contemporaneous and fossil record of the species since 4700 ka cal BP. The derived climatic niche of P. simplex shows a marked preference for areas with seasonality precipitation patterns and tropical/subtropical conditions. Geographical estimations and climatic niches derived revealed a moderate overlapping between contemporaneous and Pampean late-Holocene projection, which in no case includes the localities where fossil data were found. Although a better comprehension of the ecological requirements of the species is necessary to discard a shift in its realized climatic niche, it is probable that P. simplex is able to maintain stable populations under similar conditions to the ones represented by fossil occurrences. The distribution of the species in the Humid Pampa subregion is probably affected by non-climatic factors today which are reducing its contemporaneous realized climatic niche and distorting the derived climatic niches obtained. These results support that this species cannot be considered a reliable palaeoclimatic indicator of more Brazilian conditions in the Humid Pampean subregion during the past. © The Author(s) 2022.",Brazilian false rise rat; climate change; human impact; Humid Pampa; niche modelling; palaeoecological indicator,fossil record,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133313954,,TRUE,

Hydrothermal vents and methane seeps are typical extreme deep-sea chemosynthetic habitats for marine macrobenthos. Characterizing the evolutionary history and adaptive strategy of barnacles is fundamentally important for understanding their origin, speciation, and diversification. Herein, we performed a series of phylogenetic analyses focusing on the mitochondrial genomes of the main extant barnacle lineages. Phylogenetic inferences and topology tests contradict the view of the sister relationship between verrucomorphs and balanomorphs, instead revealing that pollicipedids, calanticids and balanomorphs share common ancestor. Selective pressure analyses indicate that the two barnacle lineages of chemosynthetic ecosystems exhibit similar patterns in their evolution of adaptive characters, but have diverse and specific positive substitution sites of mitogenomes. Divergence times suggest that chemosynthetic barnacles originated in the Cenozoic, coinciding with the origins of other metazoan animals in chemosynthetic habitats as well as the Paleogene mass extinction and oceanic anoxic events. It is reasonable to suppose that ecological niche vacancy, sitotaxis, gene specificity in adaptive stress responses, and the subdivision of the ecological niche contributed to the origin and diversification of barnacles in chemosynthetic ecosystems.

The aim of the study was to study certain human circumstances of the mining activities, reveal the former ecological conditions which influenced the sedimentation processes and investigate how the changing climatic conditions led to the formation of the fossil macrofaunal assemblage of the archaeological site. The removal of ca. 25 m3 of pigment material from the pits was equivalent to a maximum of 8750–11042 transport occasions per person, although the pre-transport processing of the material could notably reduce the weight of the transportable pigment and the time demand. Based on the lower thermal comfort limit, mining activities could be performed predominantly in the summer months. In the relatively humid Bølling-Allerød period, the redeposition of the excavated barren material to the cavity could be rapid after the termination of the mining activity. In the Younger Dryas Stadial and the early Holocene, the recharge and covering of the former pits with sediment could be slow and it started to increase only in the mid-Holocene period. The modelling of the potential distribution range of five macrofaunal elements indicates that all the species occurred at the site in the Bølling-Allerød period in the wider environment of the Lovas red ochre mine. The reconstructed boreal forest biome in the time of cultivation of the mine can explain well the dominance of fossil elk bones found in the fossil assemblage. © 2022 The Author(s)",Climate niche; Environmental modelling; Niche-conservativism; Upper pleistocene,Archaeological site; Climate niche; Condition; Environmental model; Hungary; Mining activities; Niche-conservativism; Pleistocene; Sedimentation process; Upper pleistocene; Architecture; archaeology; assembly rule; Bolling; climate conditions; environmental modeling; fossil record; mire; niche; paleobiogeography; paleoenvironment; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; sedimentation; Younger Dryas; Hungary; Transdanubia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135951283,,FALSE,

However, inferences of their (palaeo)ecology have mostly been qualitative, making it difficult to track how dietary niches have changed through time and across clades. Here, we tackle this issue by applying a novel geometric morphometric protocol to three-dimensional models of tooth crowns across a wide range of raptorial marine amniotes. Our results highlight the phenomenon of dental simplification and widespread convergence in marine amniotes, limiting the range of tooth crown morphologies. Importantly, we quantitatively demonstrate that tooth crown shape and size are strongly associated with diet, whereas crown surface complexity is not. The maximal range of tooth shapes in both mammals and reptiles is seen in medium-sized taxa; large crowns are simple and restricted to a fraction of the morphospace. We recognize four principal raptorial guilds within toothed marine amniotes (durophages, generalists, flesh cutters and flesh piercers). Moreover, even though all these feeding guilds have been convergently colonized over the last 200 Myr, a series of dental morphologies are unique to the Mesozoic period, probably reflecting a distinct ecosystem structure. © 2022 The Author(s).",Cetacea; feeding guilds; high-density morphometrics; marine reptiles; palaeoecology,cetacean; ecological approach; guild; marine environment; morphometry; paleoecology; reptile; shape analysis; size; tooth; Triassic; trophic cascade; anatomy and histology; animal; ecosystem; evolution; feeding behavior; mammal; reptile; tooth; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Mammals; Reptiles; Tooth,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137750832,,FALSE,

Nevertheless, BIPV implementation remains a niche development. Various studies have discussed the barriers to BIPV implementation. However, very few studies have endeavoured to investigate the complex interrelationships among the barriers to BIPV implementation in Singapore. In this study, the barriers to BIPV implementation in Singapore are first addressed by a literature review and then verified by local academics and industry experts. Additionally, the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach is deployed to investigate the contextual interrelationships among the identified barriers. Then, a hierarchical structure of the barriers is developed through the ISM method, and the barriers are categorized by clusters, with cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to the classification technique. In addition to the economic-related issues proposed by previous research, which has concentrated on nonspecific BIPV implementation barriers, the findings show that the lack of professionals and the absence of cost-effective BIPV products and design tools should be given specific attention for BIPV implementation in Singapore. The findings offer valuable information on the overall structure and interrelationships among the barriers to Singapore's BIPV industry, and a three-step plan for unlocking the potential of BIPV implementation is proposed.

The study of the effects of paleoclimatic and geological changes on genetic diversity, genetic structure, and species differentiation of desert plants is not only helpful in understanding the strategies of adaptation of plants to arid habitats, but can also provide reference for the protection and restoration of vegetation in desert ecosystem. Northwest China is an important part of arid regions in the northern hemisphere. Convolvulus tragacanthoides and Convolvulus gortschakovii are closely related and have similar morphology. Through our field investigation, we found that the annual precipitation of the two species distribution areas is significantly different. Thus, C. tragacanthoides and C. gortschakovii provide an ideal comparative template to investigate the evolutionary processes of closely related species, which have adapted to different niches in response to changes in paleogeography and paleoclimate in northwest China. In this study, we employed phylogeographical approaches (two cpDNA spacers: rpl14–rpl36 and trnT–trnY) and species distribution models to trace the demographic history of C. tragacanthoides and C. gortschakovii, two common subshrubs and small shrubs in northwest China. The results showed the following: (1) Populations of C. tragacanthoides in northwest China were divided into three groups: Tianshan Mountains—Ili Valley, west Yin Mountains—Helan Mountains-Qinglian Mountains, and Qinling Mountains—east Yin Mountains. There was a strong correlation between the distribution of haplotypes and the floristic subkingdom. The three groups corresponded to the Eurasian forest subkingdom, Asian desert flora subkingdom, and Sino-Japanese floristic regions, respectively. Thus, environmental differences among different flora may lead to the genetic differentiation of C. tragacanthoides in China. (2) The west Yin Mountains—Helan Mountains-Qinglian Mountains, and Qinling Mountains—east Yin Mountains were thought to form the ancestral distribution range of C. tragacanthoides. (3) C. tragacanthoides and C. gortschakovii adopted different strategies to cope with the Pleistocene glacial cycle. Convolvulus tragacanthoides contracted to the south during the glacial period and expanded to the north during the interglacial period; and there was no obvious north–south expansion or contraction of C. gortschakovii during the glacial cycle. (4) The interspecific variation of C. tragacanthoides and C. gortschakovii was related to the orogeny in northwest China caused by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during Miocene. (5) The 200 mm precipitation line formed the dividing line between the niches occupied by C. tragacanthoides and C. gortschakovii, respectively. In this study, from the perspective of precipitation, the impact of the formation of the summer monsoon limit line on species divergence and speciation is reported, which provides a new perspective for studying the response mechanism of species to the formation of the summer monsoon line, and also provides a clue for predicting how desert plants respond to future environmental changes. © 2022 The Authors.

Understanding the historical distribution of Cedrus and the driving factors can provide valuable information for the conservation of these species. In this study, we collected current distribution data and pollen fossil records for Cedrus. We used MaxEnt to simulate the distribution of Cedrus in the Mediterranean region and western Himalaya during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the middle Holocene (MH), present and future in response to different climate scenarios. Our simulation results indicate that winter precipitation is the key factor that determines the distribution of Cedrus, followed by winter temperature. The results also show that summer precipitation had a more important impact in the Mediterranean region than in the western Himalaya. The results indicate that climate change exerts a significant impact on the distribution of Cedrus in the Mediterranean, but not as much as in the western Himalaya. This could be attributed to the greater availability of microclimates (climate niche space) in the latter region. The availability of microclimates associated with the complex topography in the western Himalaya. The simulated results are generally consistent with fossil data. In the Mediterranean region, the suitability of the habitats for Cedrus decreased continuously from the LGM to the year 2070, with a distinct drop from the LGM to the MH. In the western Himalaya, the potential suitability of habitats for Cedrus increased from the LGM to the MH, but might fluctuate in the future. In general, this study identifies the key climate factors restricting the natural distribution of Cedrus. It shows that the distribution of Cedrus would be reduced in response to global climate change in the future, which indicates an urgent need for the protection and management of Cedrus populations. © 2022 The Author(s)",Cedrus; Climate change; Endangered species; MaxEnt model; Pollen,Climate models; Conservation; Ecosystems; Population distribution; Topography; Cedri; Driving factors; Endangered species; Himalayas; Holocenes; Last Glacial Maximum; MaxEnt models; Mediterranean region; Pinaceae; Pollen; Climate change; climate change; conservation; endangered species; global climate; pollen; Himalayas,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134656124,,TRUE,

According to the fossil record, three species inhabited southern Brazil in the recent past: Hemiauchenia paradoxa, Lama guanicoe, and Vicugna vicugna. The analysis of carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios in bioapatite provides insight into the paleobiology of nonliving animals and the environment they used to inhabit. We applied this tool to investigate the diet of camelids from two geological localities in southern Brazil: Touro Passo and Santa Vitória Formations (H. paradoxa, n = 7; L. guanicoe, n = 6; V. vicugna, n = 4). Carbon stable isotopes from enamel, dentin, and bone indicated that H. paradoxa and L. guanicoe had diets comprising mostly C3 grasses, but the latter showed a broader diet due to one individual with a mixed diet, whereas V. vicugna had a mixed C3-C4 diet. These different foraging behaviors may have minimized interspecific competition and favored niche partitioning and the coexistence of related species. Combined oxygen and carbon isotope data showed a consistent diet according to climate, probably due to the greater availability in glacial periods of cool-season grasses, which mainly use the C3 photosynthetic pathway. Given their adaptations to grazing, the climate amelioration, followed by the loss of grasslands, likely had a great impact on camelid populations, leading to their extinction in southern Brazil. These results, therefore, contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of paleocommunities in this region. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Exploring past, present, and future climate change effects on the distribution of Mexican beech involves the study of spatial ecology and temporal patterns to develop conservation plans. These are key to understanding the niche conservatism of other forest communities with similar environmental requirements. For this study, we used species distribution models by combining occurrence records, to assess the distribution patterns and changes of the past (Last Glacial Maximum), present (1981–2010), and future (2040–2070) periods under two climate scenarios (SSP 3-7.0 & SSP 5-8.5). Next, we determined the habitat suitability and priority conservation areas of Mexican beech as associated with topography, land cover use, distance to the nearest town, and environmental variables. By considering the distribution of Mexican beech during different periods and under different climate scenarios, our study estimated that high-impact areas of Mexican beech forests were restricted to specific areas of the Sierra Madre Oriental that constitute refugia from the Last Glacial Maximum. Regrettably, our results exhibited that Mexican beech distribution has decreased 71.3% since the Last Glacial Maximum and this trend will for the next 50 years, migrating to specific refugia at higher altitudes. This suggests that the states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, and Puebla will preserve the habitat suitability features as ecological refugia, related to high moisture and north-facing slopes.

However, temporal patterns in hydropower generation (and flow releases that affect aquatic biota) may change with increased wind and solar penetration. We used power cost modeling to characterize current and future within-day and seasonal patterns in hydropower generation across the Eastern Interconnection in a wet and a dry year. Compared to the baseline, future hydropower generation across the grid decreased during the day and increased before dawn and after dusk. At a project level, such a pattern would suggest ‘double peaking’ operation (up- and down-ramping before dawn and after dusk, with lower releases midday). Variation in generation was higher in wet years than dry years, foreshadowing possible flow constraints on hydropower flexibility. At the grid scale, projected ramping rates were higher in all seasons. A review of the ecological literature suggests that these changes would shift the timing of invertebrate drift and elevate the risk of nest scouring during up-ramping and the risk of stranding or dewatering during down ramping. Thermal conditions may be moderated by increased ramping. Strategies for adapting to future shifts in the renewable portfolio range from re-regulation in reservoir cascades to providing flow refuge (structures and vegetation) below individual projects. Coordinated basin-scale operation can distribute peaking operation to maintain grid support while restricting local ramping at critical ecological times. In addition, research to design hybrid renewable systems that add battery storage is needed to understand how we can mitigate future risks to aquatic communities while promoting the use of renewable energy. This study, which is among the first to examine ecological side-effects of the shift to renewable energy in freshwater ecosystems, lays out a path toward understanding and navigating changes to flow regimes under the energy transition. © 2022 The Authors",Dewatering; Double peaking; Hydropeaking; Hydropower; PLEXOS; Ramping; Solar; Stranding; Temporal niche; Wind,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134759282,,FALSE,

However, for many species, these variables may not be understood under the context of current conditions alone. Here, we assess the potential role historical changes in climate, sea level and anthropogenic activity may have had on the distribution of one of the world's least-understood wild cats and identify broader implications for conservation efforts that may not be apparent from just an examination of the species' current distribution. Location: Tropical Asia. Taxon: Fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus). Methods: We used a presence-only ecological niche model and a least-cost graph-based connectivity model to characterize the species' bio-climatic niche and predict changes in suitability and connectivity under current and paleoenvironmental conditions. Results: Fishing cat occurrence was associated with landscapes that were low in elevation and high in topographic wetness and climates that were warm with moderate annual precipitation and moderate seasonal variation in both temperature and precipitation. Since the Last Interglacial, the area predicted to be climatically suitable has ranged from 5.9 million km2 during the Last Glacial Maximum to 2.2 million km2 during the Current Era. Changes in regional connectivity correlated with changes in suitable area for all periods except the Current Era. Relative connectivity of areas affected by past sea level rise was highest in areas with large alluvial plains, emergent coastal areas and deltas. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that the fishing cat's current distribution and vulnerability can be explained by a synergistic combination of historical climate change, sea level rise, and anthropogenic land-use change. Changes in suitability and connectivity over time highlight potential core areas that are underrepresented by historical survey efforts. Future survey efforts should include these areas, with an emphasis on quantifying tolerances to anthropogenic disturbances. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",biogeography; climate change; ecological niche modelling; Felidae; Last Glacial Maximum; least-cost path; Maxent; species distribution modelling; topographic wetness index; Tropical Asia,biogeography; climate change; ecological modeling; felid; Holocene; human activity; land use change; Last Glacial Maximum; Pleistocene; population distribution; sea level change; seasonal variation; topography; vulnerability; Asia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131076704,,TRUE,

However, scientists have insufficient attention to the issues related to the elements that contribute to justifying these impacts and bolstering its response in BRI nations. Accordingly, the existent study executed an in-depth examination of the spatial direct and spillover effects of foreign direct investment inflows (FDI) and biomass energy consumption (BEC) on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for 57 BRI countries (1992–2012). We applied the spatial lag model (SLM), the spatial error model (SEM), and the spatial Durbin model (SDM) with five different weights matrices to verify the existence of the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH), the pollution halo hypothesis (P-HH), and the N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). We linked the study results with the implementation level of the sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The findings of local Moran’s I (LMI) and Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests confirm the existence of spatial autocorrelation (SAR). The empirical results revealed that FDI has a positive direct and spillover influence on GHG emissions, which supports the presence of PHH. Also, the nexus between economic growth and GHG emission is an N-shaped curve. The results revered that BEC has a negative sign for direct and spillover effects. In contrast to BEC, Fossil Fuel Energy Consumption (FFEC) and population positively sign for direct and indirect impact.

Within southern Africa, palaeoclimatic shifts possibly homogenised subtropical Afromontane forest biodiversity, yet these forests continue to harbour unique diversity. For the three songbird species with different natural histories, we investigated the refugial role of subtropical Afromontane and scarp forests and explored specifically how palaeoclimatic events impacted genetic connectivity among forest patches. Location: Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Biodiversity Hotspot, south-eastern South Africa. Taxon: Batis capensis, Phylloscopus ruficapilla and Pogonocichla stellata. Methods: Mitochondrial control region sequences and microsatellite data were used to assess genetic diversity and population structure among 406 birds. Demographic change was inferred using Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs), and approximate Bayesian computations (ABCs) were used to identify gene flow trends among putative refugia. Environmental niche models (ENMs) were used to infer past occurrence probabilities. Results: Species BSPs supported regional presence predating the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya) and indicated post-glacial population expansions. ABC modelling revealed that present-day gene flow trends emerged largely during the current interglacial (<12 kya), suggesting that thermal maxima promote regional forest expansion. The north-eastern source of gene flow in all the three species suggested a post-glacial influx from refugia further north, while southern scarp forests sustained secondary source populations for B. capensis and P. ruficapilla. High gene flow signatures from south-western forests in B. capensis and especially P. stellata alluded to hidden source populations in the under-surveyed southern Afrotemperate forests—the southernmost Afromontane forest bloc. ENMs corroborated both scarp and southern Afrotemperate forests as glacial refugia and demonstrated persistent regional population presence over the past 120 kya. Main Conclusions: The population genetics and palaeodistribution of the three bird species indicate their regional persistence throughout the late Pleistocene, suggesting that Afromontane and scarp forests of south-eastern South Africa served as refugia for subtropical African avian forest biota. © 2022 The Authors.

The basic goal of an ETS is to promote green and low-carbon development. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China, taken from 2006 to 2018, this paper analyzes the impact of ETSs on the development of renewable energy. A spatial Durbin model (SDM) is used to explore the spatial spillover effects of China's ETS on the development of renewable energy. Then, a multiple mediation model is applied to explore the specific paths through which China's ETS affects the development of renewable energy. The results show that the implementation of China's ETS inhibits the development of renewable energy in the policy implementation areas. However, the development of renewable energy in neighboring areas will be promoted. In addition, the spatial spillover effect is greater than the direct inhibition effect, so the overall effect is promotion. Furthermore, ETSs can affect the development of renewable energy by following multiple mediation paths, including fossil energy consumption, energy intensity and green technology innovation. Fossil energy consumption is the most critical transmission mechanism through which China's ETS affects the development of renewable energy, playing a 73% role in the overall mediation effect.

Found across four continents, Dugesia may have either an ancient origin on a large palaeo landmass, followed by colonisation in different regions before continental fragmentation, or a more recent origin and subsequent transoceanic dispersal. We seek to resolve between these two hypotheses. Location: Africa, Eurasia and Australasia. Taxon: Genus Dugesia (Platyhelminthes: Tricladida: Dugesiidae). Methods: We used data from the sequencing of six gene fragments and comprehensive taxonomic sampling of Dugesia from across its distribution range to reconstruct the phylogeny of this genus using maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods. We conducted two phylogenetic dating analyses using Platyhelminthes fossils and palaeogeological events. Basing on the time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic framework we evaluated the contribution of vicariance and dispersal to the biogeographical evolution of Dugesia. By reconstructing the ancestral areas and present-day potential distribution using BioGeoBEARS and niche modelling, we elucidated the biogeographical history of the genus. Results: The present-day distribution of Dugesia is a result of different vicariance and dispersal events. However, we also found evidence of transoceanic dispersal. Consistent with previous hypotheses, Dugesia dates to the Upper Jurassic in the Afro-Malagasy Gondwana region. We unveiled a novel biogeographical scenario for the genus, involving multiple events of colonisation in Eurasia from continental Africa via at least three dispersal routes. Main conclusions: Dugesia is an ancient genus having reached its present distribution through a complex history of dispersal and vicariant events following its origin in southern Gondwana. Despite the low vagility of Dugesia, we found evidence of their overseas dispersal. © 2022 The Authors.

Intriguingly, parthenogenetic individuals and species are as common as or even more common than sexuals in some major and putative ancient animal lineages such as oribatid mites and rotifers. Here, we analyzed oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) as a model group because these mites are ancient (early Paleozoic), widely distributed around the globe, and include a high number of parthenogenetic species, which often co-exist with sexual oribatid mite species. There is evidence that the reproductive mode is phylogenetically conserved in oribatid mites, which makes them an ideal model to test hypotheses on the relationship between reproductive mode and species' ecological strategies. We used oribatid mites to test the frozen niche variation hypothesis; we hypothesized that parthenogenetic oribatid mites occupy narrow specialized ecological niches. We used the geographic range of species as a proxy for specialization as specialized species typically do have narrower geographic ranges than generalistic species. After correcting for phylogenetic signal in reproductive mode and demonstrating that geographic range size has no phylogenetic signal, we found that parthenogenetic lineages have a higher probability to have broader geographic ranges than sexual species arguing against the frozen niche variation hypothesis. Rather, the results suggest that parthenogenetic oribatid mite species are more generalistic than sexual species supporting the general-purpose genotype hypothesis. The reason why parthenogenetic oribatid mite species are generalists with wide geographic range sizes might be that they are of ancient origin reflecting that they adapted to varying environmental conditions during evolutionary history. Overall, our findings indicate that parthenogenetic oribatid mite species possess a widely adapted general-purpose genotype and therefore might be viewed as “Jack-of-all-trades.”. © 2022 The Authors.

Here, we use an integrative approach to understand how palaeogeographical and environmental processes shape species distribution and focus on freshwater planarians as the model system. Location: Western Mediterranean. Taxon: Dugesia. Methods: We inferred the phylogenetic relationships of most known Dugesia species in the area using six molecular markers. We then estimated their divergence times and reconstructed their ancestral distribution ranges. We also performed environmental niche modelling analyses using Dugesia subtentaculata as a model to evaluate the effects of several hydro-environmental variables and the likely existence of interspecific competition on Dugesia distributions. Results: Our results provide a new phylogenetic scheme for Dugesia from the Western Mediterranean and show that the time splits between the lineages and their putative ancestral distribution ranges are correlated with microplate tectonic dynamics within the region during the Oligocene–Miocene period. Our environmental niche modelling analyses indicate that the type of land cover and the slope of the terrain are the most important abiotic factors driving the distribution of Dugesia from this region. Finally, we found a partial niche overlap between D. subtentaculata and two other common planarian species from the Iberian Peninsula. Main conclusions: The microplate tectonic dynamics of the Western Mediterranean during the Oligocene–Miocene period, together with the position of the mountain ranges and posterior climate changes, may have played crucial roles in driving the biogeographical history of Dugesia in this region. Moreover, both interspecific competition and changes in fluvial characteristics driven by human activities may affect the current diversity and distribution of Dugesia in the Western Mediterranean.

Modern palaeoecological and phylogeographical data support earlier hypotheses that these grasslands are late Pleistocene relicts and can therefore be considered part of the Eurasian forest–steppe biome. However, it is still unclear which factors fostered the maintenance of steppe patches in Central Europe throughout the Holocene. Here, we provide an overview of the main hypotheses, which stress, respectively, the effects of climate, edaphic conditions and disturbances. We then develop a general conceptual framework on how these three factors interact to form forest–steppe mosaics. We thereby emphasize the role of topography as a crucial control on forest–steppe patterns at the landscape scale. Topography is related to several mechanistic drivers that influence vegetation processes, such as near-surface microclimate and soil formation. Consequently, topographic variation allows both forest and steppe patches to occur beyond their macroclimatic niche, favouring the development of forest–steppe mosaics. To illustrate our framework, we demonstrate the interactive effect of macroclimate and topography on the occurrence of steppe patches at 108 selected Central European forest–steppe sites. Although we developed our framework focusing on the current distribution of Central European forest–steppe, we suggest that it contributes to the understanding of similar transitions between temperate forest and steppe biomes in the past as well as elsewhere in the world. © 2022 The Authors.

Recently, a genomic analysis revealed the unexpected gene flow between the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and the dhole (Cuon alpinus). The two species have currently highly disjunct and patchy distributions in Africa and Asia, respectively, which are remnants of a much wider past distribution. Yet, no reported evidence of their past contact has ever been documented. By hindcasting the past potential distribution of both species during the Last Glacial Maximum and the Last Interglacial, validating paleoclimatic reconstructions with fossil evidence, quantifying the intersection of their bioclimatic niches, and assessing interspecific compatibility, we investigate the location and favorable conditions for such contact and its ecological validity. We were able to identify the Levant region in Eastern Mediterranean during the Last Interglacial as the most suitable spatio-ecological context for the co-occurrence of the two canids, and to provide evidence of a highly significant overlap of the African wild dog niche with the wider niche of the dhole. These results, combined with ecologic traits, including key compatibility features such as cooperative breeding and hunting, provide consistent support for the potential co-occurrence of both canids. We suggest that the ranges of these canids came into contact multiple times during periods resembling the Last Interglacial, eventually facilitating gene flow between the African wild dog and the dhole in their post-divergence history. Our results are highly supportive of the key role of the Levant region in providing connectivity between African and Eurasian faunas and provide further impetus to combine different tools and approaches in advancing the understanding of species evolutionary histories.

Methods: We constructed a dated phylogeny of extant and extinct diatoms and collected trait data for 380 fossil communities to quantify phylogenetic community structure and functional richness and to determine the relative importance of deterministic assembly processes over time. We then used regression analysis to correlate the phylogenetic community structure with palaeoenvironmental and intrinsic biological predictors and to identify primary drivers of assembly processes. Results: Our results suggest a dense packing of niche space with higher species richness and co-occurrence of closely related species. There are only two short episodes in the very recent past dominated by distantly related taxa. We found distinct changes in phylogenetic community structure upon speciation or extinction events and an increase in mean community relatedness over time. Main conclusions: Our finding of closely related co-occurring species implies environmental filtering as the primary assembly mechanism, with a minor but increasingly important role of competition towards the present, driven by evolutionary dynamics. Such an increase in the relative contribution of competition to the assembly of communities in relation to the aging of an insular ecosystem, together with a denser packing of morphospace in the early phase of system ontogeny is compatible with ecological predictions according to the theory of island biogeography. © 2022 The Authors.

This study is the first to apply ecological niche modelling on a long time-series of archaeological data to illuminate the development of the landscape from the perspective of settlement behaviour and its dependence on environmental conditions. Using a large dataset of evidence of prehistoric settlement activities covering the area of the Czech Republic and spanning 6600 years from the beginning of agricultural prehistory, we analyse to what degree settlement was related to environmental parameters. We quantified the strength of this relation in terms of the predictive power of ecological niche models generated with the MaxEnt method. We observed a significant variability of settlement behaviour over time, but also landscape occupation, which has retained similar general characteristics to now. This shows that settlement strategies were remarkably stable and the presence of previous settlement was beneficial for subsequent land-use. Comparison of prehistoric settlement with contemporary landscape typology also points to a long-term legacy pre-dating historical periods, which makes the landscape our largest and most important heritage monument. © 2022",Ecological niche; Environment; Landscape; MaxEnt; Prehistory; Settlement,archaeology; ecological modeling; human settlement; landscape; maximum entropy analysis; niche; paleoenvironment; prehistoric; time series analysis; Czech Republic,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125282307,,TRUE,

With increasing antibiotic resistance in human pathogens, it is necessary to examine the habitats having community interests. In the present study, a metagenomic approach has been employed to understand the causes, dissemination, and effects of antibiotic, metal, and biocide resistomes on the microbial ecology of three hot springs, Borong, Lingdem, and Yumthang, located at different altitudes of the Sikkim Himalaya. The taxonomic assessment of these hot springs depicted the predominance of mesophilic organisms, mainly belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria. The enriched microbial metabolism assosiated with energy, cellular processes, adaptation to diverse environments, and defence were deciphered in the metagenomes. The genes representing resistance to semisynthetic antibiotics, e.g., aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin, vancomycin, trimethoprim, tetracycline, streptomycin, beta-lactams, multidrug resistance, and biocides such as triclosan, hydrogen peroxide, acriflavin, were abundantly present. Various genes attributing resistance to copper, arsenic, iron, and mercury in metal resistome were detected. Relative abundance, correlation, and genome mapping of metagenome-assembled genomes indicated the co-evolution of antibiotic and metal resistance in predicted novel species belonging to Vogesella, Thiobacillus, and Tepidimona genera. The metagenomic findings were further validated with isolation of microbial cultures, exhibiting resistance against antibiotics and heavy metals, from the hot spring water samples. The study furthers our understanding about the molecular basis of co-resistomes in the ceological niches and their possible impact on the environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Antibiotic resistance; Biocides; Heavy metal resistance; Himalaya; Hot springs; MAGs,"acriflavine; aminoglycoside; antibiotic agent; arsenic; beta lactam; biocide; calcium; copper; fosfomycin; germanium; heavy metal; hydrogen peroxide; lithium; mercury; molybdenum; quinolone derivative; scandium; sodium; streptomycin; tetracycline; triclosan; trimethoprim; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; disinfectant agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; gene expression; genome; metabolism; microbial ecology; molecular analysis; pesticide; spring water; thermal spring; altitude; antibiotic resistome; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; controlled study; DNA extraction; gene mapping; Himalaya; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; mesophilic bacterium; metagenomics; metal tolerance; microbial community; microbial genome; microbial metabolism; nonhuman; Proteobacteria; Sikkim; taxonomy; thermal spring; thermophilic bacterium; Thiobacillus; human; metagenomics; Himalayas; Sikkim Himalayas; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Disinfectants; Hot Springs; Humans; Metagenomics; Metals, Heavy",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123717550,,FALSE,

It is necessary to study the climate variation within its range in order to understand the effects of climate change on longleaf pine forests. In this study, past climate data at three sites within the longleaf pine range were used to detect climate variation. The results indicated no dramatic change in solar radiation at the three sites. There were high variations in annual air temperature at the three sites. The trend of annual air temperature change depended on the time scale and start/end time. The annual air temperature generally increased from the 1960s at three sites. However, from 1901 to 2020, the trend of increasing annual air temperature was not consistent. The annual precipitation and the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index were relatively stable, with variation at the three sites. The regimes of annual and monthly air temperature and precipitation were not shifted based on the analysis of multiscale entropy. The climate niche of longleaf pine forests based on long-term climate data was broader than previously found. These results may be helpful to understand the interactions of the atmosphere and growth of longleaf pine forest and develop relevant management strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

We evaluated the genetic structure and temporal environmental niche dynamics of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) in 48 populations. The genetic evaluation was performed through amplified fragment length poly-morphism (AFLP) molecular markers. The maximum entropy method was used to model the past, present, and future environmental niches of the three clusters derived from the genetic analysis. The environmental niches of the three genetic clusters showed dynamic overlaps and isolations during the last interglacial and glacial maximum. The paleoclimatic events, which occurred during those periods, may have reinforced genetic exchange among populations and affected their genetic structure. Genetic clusters also presented different environmental niches in the present. Thus, they can be considered as three distinct ecotypes and restoration programs must be carried out using local germplasm from each environmental niche to increase their chance of success. Based on the environmental niches of the genetic clusters, changes are expected in the near and mid-century future. Therefore, climate change must be considered for species conservation management and future restoration programs. © 2022 by the authors.

Yet, comparative studies are lacking for southern African herpetofauna, despite their high diversity. We statistically compare phylogeographic structure and divergence-time estimates among five co-distributed forest-living herpetofaunal taxa to assess rivers, climatic refugia and climatic gradients as congruent drivers of phylogeographic diversity. Location: Maputoland-Pondoland-Albany biodiversity hotspot, Southern Africa. Taxon: herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians). Methods: Phylogeographic structure and divergence-times within species were estimated from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. Phylogeographic concordance factors were used to estimate the degree of phylogeographic congruence among sympatric localities. Full-likelihood Bayesian comparisons were used to estimate synchronous divergence between phylogeographic regions and across a putative river barrier. Palaeoclimatic niche models were compared among taxa to identify congruent climatic refugia. Nonparametric statistics were used to identify climatic differences between regions and among populations within each species. Finally, redundancy analyses were used to assess geographic distance, climate and the putative river barrier as explanatory variables to genetic diversity. Results: There is comprehensive phylogeographic structuring within each species, comprising distinct northerly and southerly clades. Phylogeographic concordance factors generally support co-diversification in a north/south axis. Yet, analyses of the divergence-time estimates through the Mio/Plio/Pleistocene indicate asynchronous phylogeographic histories. Climatic niche models identified idiosyncratic responses to palaeoclimatic change. Climatic variables are significantly different among populations in all species and correlated with latitude. A combined model of distance, climate and rivers explained the greatest proportion of genetical diversity in most taxa, of which climate explained the highest variance. Main Conclusions: Ancient and recent species-specific responses to climatic and geological processes resulted in pseudo congruent phylogeographic histories among the five co-distributed species. The presence of a congruent north/south pattern in multiple taxonomic groups occupying different forested microhabitats, from fossorial to arboreal, supports latitudinal gradients as global drivers of phylogeographic diversity along the east coast of South Africa. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",comparative phylogeography; herpetofauna; Maputoland-Pondoland-Albany; niche models; phylogeographic concordance; southern Africa; synchronous divergence,biodiversity; divergence; herpetofauna; hot spot; mitochondrial DNA; perturbation; phylogeography; Albany [Eastern Cape]; Eastern Cape; KwaZulu-Natal; Maputaland; Pondoland; South Africa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125561658,,FALSE,

The general reduction of these biomes is hypothesized to shape the diversity and biogeographical history of tropical plant clades. However, this has rarely been examined owing to a paucity of good fossil records of tropical taxa and the difficulty in assigning them to modern clades. Here, we evaluate the role that Cenozoic climate change might have played in shaping the diversity and biogeography of tropical plants through time. Location: Global. Time period: Cenozoic, 66 Ma to present. Major taxa studied: Four palm clades (Calaminae, Eugeissoneae, Mauritiinae and Nypoideae) and their fossil pollen record. Methods: We compiled fossil pollen occurrence records for each focal palm lineage to reconstruct their diversity and biogeographical distribution throughout the Cenozoic. We use climatic niche models to project the distribution of climatically suitable areas for each lineage in the past, using palaeoclimatic data for the Cenozoic. Results: For most palm lineages examined, global pollen taxonomic diversity declined throughout the Cenozoic. Geographical ranges for each focal lineage contracted globally and experienced regional-scale extinctions (e.g., Afrotropics), particularly after the Miocene. However, climatic niche models trained on extant species of these focal lineages often predict the presence of climatically suitable habitat in areas where these lineages went extinct. Main conclusions: Globally, the decline in megathermal rain forest and mangrove extent might have led to declines in diversity and range contractions in some megathermal plant taxa throughout the Cenozoic. Although global climatic trends are an important backdrop for the biogeography and diversity of tropical groups at global scales, their continental- or regional-scale biogeographical trajectories might be more dependent on regional abiotic and biotic contexts. © 2021 The Authors.

We combine phylogenetic and phylogeographic inference of RADseq data with ecological niche modeling across space and time. Population structure is concurrent with major rivers in the region and we identify a new, potentially important biogeographic break coincident with several landscape features. Our data further suggests that niches occupied by species and populations differ substantially across their distribution.

They persist in patchy and isolated populations, threatened by habitat destruction and fragmentation, mortality from vehicle collisions, and deliberate extermination. Changing climates may pose an additional stressor on the survival of isolated populations. Here, we evaluate historic, modern, and future geographic projections of suitable climate for S. tergeminus to outline shifts in their potential geographic distribution and inform current and future management. We used maximum entropy modeling to build multiple models of the potential geographic distribution of S. tergeminus. We evaluated the influence of five key decisions made during the modeling process on the resulting geographic projections of the potential distribution, allowing us to identify areas of model robustness and uncertainty. We evaluated models with the area under the receiver operating curve and true skill statistic. We retained 16 models to project both in the past and future multiple general circulation models. At the last glacial maximum, the potential geographic distribution associated with S. tergeminus occurrences had a stronghold in the southern part of its current range and extended further south into Mexico, but by the mid-Holocene, its modeled potential distribution was similar to its present-day potential distribution. Under future model projections, the potential distribution of S. tergeminus moves north, with the strongest northward trends predicted under a climate scenario increase of 8.5 W/m2. Some southern populations of S. tergeminus have likely already been extirpated and will continue to be threatened by shifting availability of suitable climate, as they are already under threat from desertification of grasslands. Land use and habitat loss at the northern edge of the species range are likely to make it challenging for this species to track suitable climates northward over time. © 2022 The Authors.

This work propounds the possibility that C. atlantica and Pinus nigra could have co-habited in the past, mutually excluding each other in the areas with suitable conditions for both species, where, ultimately, the one that was the most competitive would have remained. The niche overlap in the two-dimensional ecological space was analyzed. In addition, the potential distribution of both species in the Western Mediterranean today and two past periods (Last Glacial Maximum and Mid-Holocene) was modeled to identify their common geographic area of distribution. The species showed very well differentiated niches and a distribution of their habitats virtually segregated by continents since the Mid-Holocene (P. nigra in Europe and C. atlantica in Africa), which responds to differences in climatic affinities. However, the contact of the bordering areas of their distributions in the Baetic mountain range suggests that C. atlantica could have maintained its presence in the Iberian Peninsula until recent times. P. nigra would have displace it in later stages due to its greater prevalence on the continent, so it would have had greater opportunities to occupy the available space. © 2022 by the authors.

Since their distribution varies with temperature, sedimentary isoGDGTs have been used as proxies for the reconstruction of past continental climate for almost two decades. Yet, their application in lacustrine sediments is still not well constrained because the niches of isoGDGT-producing microorganisms in lakes are often ill-defined. Here, we study the distribution of isoGDGTs and their hydroxy derivatives (OH-isoGDGTs) in the water column of the deep (288 m), meromictic northern basin of Lake Lugano (Switzerland) using quantitative analysis of various pools of isoGDGTs and the stable carbon isotopic composition of isoGDGT-derived biphytanes. We provide strong evidence for archaeal water column sources of the isoGDGTs, based on comparison of lipid data with microbial diversity determined by 16S rRNA next generation sequencing. We find highest concentrations (i.e., 40 ng L−1) of crenarchaeol, the isoGDGTs specific for thaumarchaea, in suspended particle matter (SPM) from deeper (30–100 m) waters below the thermocline. This correlates well with thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene abundances, comprised by a single thaumarchaeote of the order Nitrosopumilales. The concentrations of OH-isoGDGT with 0–2 cyclopentane rings follow this profile, suggesting an identical archaeal source. In the deeper anoxic waters, the archaeal community changes substantially and was comprised of various members of the Bathyarchaeota, Diapherotrites, Euryarchaeota, and Woesearchaeota. This change is accompanied by a changing distribution of isoGDGTs with a high contribution of GDGT-0 with a polar head group, and a more negative δ13C value of the acyclic biphytane derived thereof. Comparison of the isoGDGT composition (distribution and δ13C) in the surface sediment with that of the sinking particle flux studied over 1 year at three depths indicates substantial downward transport of isoGDGTs to the sediments from the waters between the thermocline and the anoxic hypolimnion, but not from the deeper (&gt;100 m) waters. The relatively low value for the isoGDGT-based TEX86 value (ca. 0.40) in the surface sediment is similar to that of the in-situ produced isoGDGTs in the waters below the thermocline, and is consistent with the year-around low water temperatures (&lt;6 °C). We also analyzed the isoGDGT composition in surface sediments of 36 additional (peri-)alpine lakes in Central Europe; their isoGDGT concentration and distribution show a clear-cut difference based on lake size. In relatively large and deep lakes, like the Lake Lugano North Basin, the crenarchaeol concentration was much higher than in small-sized and shallow lakes, because Nitrosopumilales spp. have seemingly no niche in shallower waters (0–∼30 m depth), and production, and hence preservation in the sedimentary record, of crenarchaeol (and other thaumarchaeal isoGDGTs) is much lower than in large lakes. We argue that in the mid-latitudinal large and deep (peri-)alpine lakes Nitrosopumilales spp. generally thrive in cold waters below the thermocline, where temperature is largely not affected by fluctuations in mean annual air temperature. Therefore, the TEX86 paleothermometer is relative insensitive to atmospheric temperature changes in these lakes.

Aims: To test this speciation model in a hypothesised sister pair, the Southwest–North African disjunct Senecio flavus and its putative progenitor, the Namibian Desert endemic S.englerianus. Methods: Phylogenetic inferences were combined with niche divergence tests, morphometrics, and experimental-genetic approaches. We also evaluated the potential role of an African Dry Corridor (ADC) in promoting the hypothesised northward expansion of S.flavus (from Namibia), using palaeodistribution models. Results: Belonging to an isolated (potential ‘relict’) clade, the two morphologically distinct species showed pronounced niche divergence in Namibia and signs of digenic-epistatic hybrid incompatibility (based on F2 pollen fertility). The presence of ‘connate-fluked’ pappus hairs in S.flavus, likely increasing dispersal ability, is controlled by a single-gene locus. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence for a possible (and rare) example of ‘budding’ speciation in which a wider-ranged derivative (S.flavus) originated at the periphery of a smaller-ranged progenitor (S.englerianus) in the Namib Desert region. The Southwest–North African disjunction of S.flavus could have been established by dispersal across intermediate ADC areas during periods of (Late) Pleistocene aridification. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, as typically implemented, SDMs treat species as genetically uniform throughout their ranges and thereby ignore potentially important genetic differences between populations. While numerous studies have used SDMs to model genetically based subgroupings within species, the ability of such models to be transferred to new times has rarely been evaluated. Here, we used standard and genetically informed distribution models (gSDMs) to predict the future and past range of balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). We then assessed model transferability of standard SDMs and gSDMs using balsam poplar fossil pollen and macrofossil occurrences. In general, standard and gSDMs performed similarly through time, with both predicting a northward expanding range from refugia as glaciers receded over the past 22 ky BP and declining suitable area in future climates. Both standard and gSDMs showed moderate abilities to distinguish balsam poplar fossils from pseudo-absences but tended to predict lower suitability at fossil sites during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Although gSDMs applied to balsam poplar did not prove more transferable than standard SDMs, they provided numerous unique insights, such as the change in suitable area of genetic clusters through time and potential refugial locations. We argue more research is needed to determine which species may benefit most from the gSDM approach and to test gSDMs with temporally or spatially independent occurrences, as is often recommended for standard SDMs. © the authors, CC-BY 4.0 license",Climate change; Ecological niche modeling; Fossil pollen; Genetic differentiation; Last glacial maximum; Paleoecology; Refugia; Species distribution models,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138104631,,TRUE,

Here, we used multi-locus genetic data along with environmental data to investigate shared phylogeographic patterns among three Asianendemic newt genera, Cynops, Paramesotriton and Pachytriton, which occurred in montane/submontane streams or ponds in southern China. Our 222 samples from 78 localities covered the entire range of the three genera and represented the largest dataset of this group to date. We reconstructed matrilineal genealogies from two protein-coding, mitochondrial genes, and gene network from two nuclear genes. We also estimated divergence times of major cladogenetic events and used occurrence data to evaluate niche difference and similarity between lineages. Our results revealed a common basal split in all three genera that corresponds to the separation of two geographic terrains of southern China. Those ancient divergence occurred during middle to late Miocene and likely correlate with paleoclimatic fluctuations caused by the uplift of the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Plateau (QTP). Particularly, the strengthening and weakening of Asian summer monsoons during the Miocene may have profoundly impacted southern China and led to repeatedly vicariance in those newts. However, despite differences in realized niches between lineages, there is no evidence for divergence of fundamental niches. Preservation of old newt matriline lineages in mountains of southern China suggests that the region acts as both museums and cradles of speciation.

Progress has been hampered by the difficulties of linking a robust empirical characterization of species niches with flexible evolutionary models that describe their evolution. Consequently, the relative influence of abiotic and biotic factors remains poorly understood. Here, we characterize species' two-dimensional temperature and precipitation niche space occupied (i.e. species niche envelope) as complex geometries and assess their evolution across all Aves using a model that captures heterogeneous evolutionary rates on time-calibrated phylogenies. We find that extant birds coevolved from warm, mesic climatic niches into colder and drier environments and responded to the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) boundary with a dramatic increase in disparity. Contrary to expectations of subsiding rates of niche evolution, our results show that overall rates have increased steadily, with some lineages experiencing exceptionally high evolutionary rates, associated with the colonization of novel niche spaces, and others showing niche stasis. Both competition- and environmental change-driven niche evolution transpire and result in highly heterogeneous rates near the present.

Exploring species-specific responses to historical and contemporary environmental changes will improve our understanding of the role of this region in maintaining biodiversity. In this study, mitochondrial and microsatellite diversities were used to assess the contributions of paleogeological events, Pleistocene climatic oscillations, and contemporary landscape characteristics to the rapid intraspecific diversification of Liangshantriton taliangensis, a vulnerable amphibian species endemic to several sky-island mountains in the southeastern HMR. Divergence date estimations suggested that the East Asian monsoon, local uplifting events (Xigeda Formation strata), and Early-Middle Pleistocene transition (EMPT) promoted rapid divergence of L. taliangensis during the Pleistocene, yielding eight mitochondrial lineages and six nuclear genetic lineages. Moreover, population genetic structures were mainly fixed through isolation by resistance. Multiple in situ refugia were identified by ecological niche models and high genetic diversity, which played crucial roles in the persistence and divergence of L. taliangensis during glacial-interglacial cycles. Dramatic climatic fluctuations further promoted recurrent isolation and admixing of populations in scattered glacial refugia. The apparent mitonuclear discordance was likely the result of introgression by secondary contact and/or female-biased dispersal. Postglacial expansion generated two major secondary contact zones (Ganluo (GL) and Chuhongjue (CHJ)).

We use otobas, a clade of ecologically dominant trees found in low-to mid-elevation wet forests, as a system to understand the relative importance of these processes within the Neotropics. Location: Neotropics and global. Taxon: Otoba and entire Myristicaceae. Methods: We resolve the first phylogeny of Otoba the Angiosperms353 loci and plastome sequences from 13 accessions representing seven species. We pair this with the most densely sampled phylogeny of Myristicaceae to date, inferred using publicly available plastid data. We then use environmental niche modelling, biogeographical reconstruction, phylogenetic principle components analysis and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models to infer biogeography and examine patterns of niche evolution. Results: Myristicaceae has an Old World origin, with a single expansion into the Americas. Divergence dates, fossil evidence and a notable lack of long-distance dispersal are consistent with a Boreotropical origin of Neotropical Myristicaceae. Mirroring the rarity of dispersal at the family level, Otoba's biogeography is marked by few biogeographical events: two expansions into Central America from a South American ancestor and a single dispersal event across the Andes. This limited movement contrasts with rapid climatic niche evolution, typically occurring across geographically proximate habitats. Main conclusion: Contrasting with previous studies, long-distance dispersal does not need to be invoked to explain the pantropical distribution of Myristicaceae, nor the biogeography of Otoba. This likely results from the family's relatively large seeds that are dispersed by large-bodied vertebrates. Instead, rapid niche evolution in Otoba has facilitated its occurrence throughout mesic habitats of the northern Neotropics, including the Amazon rainforest and Andean montane forests. Otoba adds to a growing group of Neotropical plant clades in which climate adaptation following local migration is common, implying an important role of niche evolution in the assembly of the Neotropical flora. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,adaptation; ancestry; biogeography; colonization; dispersal; fossil record; montane forest; Neotropical Region; niche; phylogeny; rainforest; range expansion; Andes; Central America,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120856349,,TRUE,

The analysis is a detailed accounting exercise that relies on estimates of emission-reduction potential from other studies and applies those potentials to the manufacturing sector using a bottom-up approach.

No single pillar dominates DDM, although opportunities vary widely by sub-sector. The analysis shows that a strategy incorporating a broad set of elements from each pillar can be effective instead of relying on any single pillar.

Their joint effect has been rarely studied. Here, we tested how Pleistocene climatic oscillations shaped the evolutionary history and distribution of a subterranean amphipod. We tested four predictions for extant populations: (i) populations of good dispersers moving along the ice-sheet margin should have homogenous genetic structure and broad tolerance to temperatures; (ii) adaptation to local temperatures evolved in poor dispersers with spatially structured populations; (iii) Pleistocene extinctions in the range of historical glaciers should reflect founder effects and high sensitivity to low temperatures; (iv) para- or allopatric speciation could unfold through diverse scenarios as a response to local adaptation and constrained dispersal. Location: North-Western part of the Balkan Peninsula, Europe. Taxon: Niphargus stygius, Amphipoda, Crustacea. Methods: We used time-calibrated multilocus phylogenies and multilocus delimitations to test independently evolving lineages. For each lineage, separately we assessed historical population dynamics and dispersal potential, modelled climatic niches and mapped them onto palaeoclimatic maps. Additionally, we conducted enzymatic and respiratory tests of thermal tolerance, and reconstructed historical distribution range using phylogeographical diffusion analyses. Results: We identified four independently evolving tentative species, dated to the Pleistocene, with no evidence of extinction events. Three main lineages are parapatric with few pairwise syntopies and no traces of hybridization. They evolved in allopatry and possibly maintained constant effective population sizes. The lineages are phylogeographically substructured, indicating low recent dispersal. They differ in their climatic niche envelopes and physiological responses to unfavourable temperatures. Main conclusions: We infer that periodic drops of groundwater in the Pleistocene caused two vicariant events and the onset of two allopatric speciation events, followed by phases of dispersal leading to secondary contact and occasional overlap of ranges.

In this study, we used multivariate dental topography analysis (DTA) to reconstruct the diet of N. magdalenensis by quantitatively comparing measures of molar complexity with those of 25 modern noctilionoid species representing all major dietary habits in bats. We found clear differences in molar complexity between dietary guilds, indicating that DTA is potentially an informative tool to study bat ecomorphology. Our results suggest N. magdalenensis was probably an omnivore or insectivore, rather than a carnivore like its modern relatives Chrotopterus auritus and Vampyrum spectrum. Also, we reconstructed the body mass of N. magdalenensis to be ~95 g, larger than most insectivorous bats, but smaller than the largest carnivorous bat (V. spectrum). Our results confirm that N. magdalenensis was not a specialized carnivore. It remains to be demonstrated that the specialized carnivory ecological niche was occupied by the same lineage of phyllostomines from at least the middle Miocene. Combining our diet and body-mass reconstructions, we suggest that N. magdalenensis exhibits morphological pre-adaptations crucial for the evolution of specialized carnivory. © The Author(s), 2021.

It is not possible to observe the ecology of fossils directly, but indirect evidence of changes in bioclimatic envelopes can be derived from no-analogue assemblages (i.e., groups of co-occurring fossils that have climatically incongruous living relatives). We identify and examine the specific pairs of no-analogue fossils within assemblages to disentangle the effects of climatic factors on past conifer extinctions and suggest which of these factors are likely to threaten southern conifer biodiversity in the future. Location: Southern Hemisphere. Time period: Cenozoic. Major taxa studied: Conifers. Methods: We use a recently developed method, “hyperoverlap”, to identify no-analogue pairs of southern conifers. We characterize each pair in terms of temperature and precipitation and evaluate temporal patterns in no-analogue pairs. These analyses represent a novel approach to studying both no-analogue fossils and past changes in bioclimatic envelopes. Results: We identified 240 no-analogue pairs in the Cenozoic record of southern conifers. Most (75.4%) observations of no-analogue pairs are likely to result from a change in the thermal (rather than hydrological) distribution between the fossil taxa and their extant counterparts, regardless of region or assemblage age. Thus, the fossil record shows some thermal lability, but strong hydrological stability in the tolerances of these plants. This implies that most southern conifers have inhabited wet climates through the Cenozoic, which is consistent with physiological evidence suggesting strong conservatism in drought tolerance. Main conclusions: Southern conifers have adapted successfully to a wide range of temperatures, but future changes in rainfall are likely to pose the greatest threat to these plants, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through increased incidence of fire in mesic areas). © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",aridification; conifer; evolution; fossil; hyperoverlap; niche conservatism,aridification; Cenozoic; coniferous tree; conservation management; fossil assemblage; fossil record; precipitation (climatology); Southern Hemisphere; Coniferophyta,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114937897,,TRUE,?

Today, wolves display considerable dietary plasticity over their range, characterised by their preferential consumption of large and medium-sized wild ungulates, supplemented by smaller prey, including small mammals, fish and plant foods. However, the origins of this dietary flexibility (arguably the key to the wolf's long persistence) are poorly understood in terms of responses to different drivers over the course of the Pleistocene, including changing climate, environment and competition from other large carnivores. Here, in the first study using direct palaeodietary measurements on British fossil wolves, carnivore competitors and potential prey species, we compare stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) evidence from three sites representing a late Middle Pleistocene interglacial (Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage [MIS] 7c-a, c.220-190ka BP), the early Devensian (last cold stage, MIS 5a, c.90-80ka BP) and the middle Devensian (MIS 3, c. 60-25ka BP). The results reveal clear patterns of changing wolf prey choice through time. Notwithstanding issues of collagen preservation obscuring some dietary choices in the oldest samples, both small and large prey (hare, horse) were taken by wolves in the MIS 7c-a interglacial, large prey only (reindeer, bison) during MIS 5a and a broader range of large prey items (horse, woolly rhinoceros, bison) during MIS 3. The results also reveal two further important aspects: (1) that where wolves and spotted hyaenas co-existed, they occupied the same dietary niche and the former was not outcompeted by the latter, and (2) that the stable isotope evidence indicates prey choices during MIS 7c-a and MIS 3 that are not in synchrony with palaeodietary reconstructions from previous studies based on wolf cranio-dental morphology. This establishes for the first time a likely lag between changing predatory behaviour and morphological response but is interestingly not seen in the wolves from MIS 5a, where the prey choices are echoed by the cranio-dental morphology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Canis lupus; Morphology; Palaeodiet; Pleistocene; Stable isotopes; Wolves,Isotopes; Mammals; Plants (botany); Canis lupus; Devensian; Fish foods; Marine oxygen isotopes; Middle Pleistocene; Palaeodiet; Pleistocene; Small mammals; Stable isotopes; Wolf; Morphology; canid; Devensian; glacial-interglacial cycle; interglacial; keystone species; marine isotope stage; paleoenvironment; prey preference; stable isotope; ungulate; Bison bison; Bison bison bison; Canidae; Canis lupus; Coelodonta antiquitatis; Mammalia; Rangifer tarandus; Ungulata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116708536,,FALSE,

Empirically, the study relies on an extensive stakeholder analysis that involved 44 organisations representing technology providers, energy companies, industry organisations, policymakers, local authorities and researchers. The results show that while several stakeholder groups could converge on key issues such as the need to support certain technological niches and the danger of a biomass lock-in, divergences regarding barriers to be removed existed between policymakers, new entrant firms, and building owners. Cities were considered important actors for the implementation of the proposed low-carbon district heating concept.

The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the terrestrial orchid genus Cypripedium to better understand the role of niche evolution and historical dispersal events in driving the radiation of the genus in North America and Eurasia. Location: Northern Hemisphere. Taxon: Cypripedium (Orchidaceae). Methods: We used a relaxed molecular clock analysis to infer phylogenetic relationships among 45 Cypripedium species and to estimate divergence times. Niche modelling was used to assess the potential distribution of each species in both continents, whereas ancestral area reconstructions using BioGeoBEARS were used to estimate changes in historical biogeography. Subsequently, the ancestral state of niche conditions was assessed for each species using maximum likelihood methods and we tested for phylogenetic signal in the evolution of niche conditions using Blomberg's K and Pagel's λ. A mantel test was used to test for a correlation between phylogenetic distances and niche overlap in Cypripedium. Results: We found that Cypripedium originated in Central America and underwent multiple dispersal events between North America and Eurasia after long-distance seed dispersal or dispersal via the Bering land bridge. The mountainous area of Southwest China provided refuge areas for Cypripedium orchids during episodes of increased glaciation. Our results further showed that Cypripedium has gradually increased its tolerance to seasonal temperature changes, providing evidence for significant niche evolution through time. No significant correlation between current niches and phylogenetic relatedness was observed. Main conclusions: Our study provides clear evidence that repeated dispersal and adaptation to increased cooling after the Eocene−Oligocene Transition has contributed to the radiation of Cypripedium in the Northern Hemisphere. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Ancestral state reconstruction; long-distance seed dispersal; niche overlap; orchid diversification; phylogenetics; species distribution modelling,adaptation; adaptive radiation; dispersal; divergence; environmental conditions; evolutionary theory; herb; molecular ecology; niche; paleobiogeography; phylogenetics; Central America; China; Eurasia; North America; Cypripedium; Orchidaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116014075,,TRUE,

Samples analyzed are from Integrated Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 369 Site U1516 in the Mentelle Basin (eastern flank of the Naturaliste Plateau, Indian Ocean, SW Australia). Site U1516 was located at 60°–62°S paleolatitude during the mid-Cretaceous, and it is the first high latitude locality in the Southern Hemisphere where planktonic foraminifera are consistently recorded across the OAE 2 interval and its associated positive δ13C excursion. The sedimentary record at Site U1516 consists of a sequence of alternating black, dark greenish gray, and light greenish gray claystone in the Cenomanian that grade to white and light gray calcareous chalk interbedded with chert in the Turonian. The correlation between the δ13C and δ18O profiles at Site U1516 and the European reference section at Eastbourne (England) coupled with the integrated calcareous plankton biostratigraphy and stable isotopic data at Site U1516, indicate that a complete record of OAE 2 at Site U1516 was recovered. Below and in the lower part of OAE 2, the planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by small-sized (125–38 μm) opportunistic species of Microhedbergella and radiolaria indicating a dominantly eutrophic regime. Above the onset of OAE 2, a trough in the δ13C profile (Plenus Carbon Isotope Event: P-CIE) coinciding with a δ18O increase may correspond to the Plenus Cold Event as observed at low latitudes, although no evidence of cooling is registered in the microfossil assemblages. At Site U1516, the middle part of OAE 2 at the initiation of the plateau phase of the δ13C profile is masked by absence of carbonate, by the highest TOC values, and high biogenic silica (dominance of radiolaria) indicating this interval corresponded to a time of highly stressed eutrophic conditions with possible shoaling of the Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD). Above this interval, bulk isotopic results yield lower δ13C values, and the CaCO3 increases are associated with the presence of even smaller-sized Microhedbergella showing cyclic fluctuations in absolute abundances with benthic foraminifera indicating dominantly eutrophic conditions likely affected by upwelling of nutrient-rich and δ13C-depleted intermediate water masses. Toward the top of OAE 2 and across the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary interval, the planktonic foraminiferal assemblages show changes in composition (e.g., Microhedbergella is replaced by Muricohedbergella), species occupying relatively deep ecological niches appear and an overall increase in diversity is observed. These features coupled with the foraminiferal species-specific δ13C and δ18O patterns reveal that Site U1516 occupied a paleoceanographic setting still affected by eutrophy likely related to enhanced input of nutrients but with episodes of stability with ecological/thermal separation in the surface waters. This interval also records the highest sea surface water paleotemperatures values estimated as 20°–23°C based on δ18O values of foraminiferal test and assuming seawater δ18O values of −1‰V-SMOW. Mesotrophic to oligotrophic conditions persisted after the OAE 2 and throughout the Turonian as evidenced by a diverse planktonic foraminiferal assemblage with different species occupying separate ecological niches in the mixed layer and thermocline. © 2021 The Authors",Cenomanian/Turonian boundary; Oceanic Anoxic Event 2; Paleoceanography; Planktonic foraminifera; Southern high latitudes; Stable carbon and oxygen isotope,Isotopes; Oceanography; Oxygen; Carbon and oxygen isotopes; Cenomanian-Turonian; Cenomanian/turonian boundary; High Latitudes; Oceanic anoxic event 2; Paleoceanography; Planktonic foraminifera; Southern high latitude; Stable carbon isotopes; Stable oxygen isotopes; Carbon; biostratigraphy; carbon isotope; Cenomanian; chert; claystone; fossil assemblage; microfossil; oxygen isotope; paleoceanography; planktonic foraminifera; population distribution; population dynamics; radiolaria; sampling; Southern Hemisphere; Turonian; East Sussex; Eastbourne; England; United Kingdom; Foraminifera,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115774071,,TRUE,?

For the mesic species inhabiting the region, coastal areas and the Nile Valley are perceived as the main pathways to disperse through desert habitats, but past connections may have also occurred throughout currently isolated mountain regions. Herein, we test the trans-Sahara mountain corridor hypothesis (i.e., mesic connectivity across Central Sahara highlands) and its role in the diversification of a small terrestrial vertebrate. Location: North Africa and Arabia. Taxon: Acanthodactylus boskianus (Squamata: Lacertidae). Methods: We integrated multi-locus mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies with species’ climate-niche modelling, including palaeo-projections. Genetic analyses aimed to assess the species’ genetic structure, identify its main mitochondrial lineages and nuclear diversity, and reconstruct its ancestral biogeography. Species’ climate-niche stability was modelled independently for the Late Pleistocene-Holocene and the Plio-Pleistocene, to infer historical climatic refugia and dispersal corridors. Results: Four spatially structured mitochondrial lineages, integrating several parapatric sub-lineages, originated during the Plio-Pleistocene. Nuclear data revealed nine potential candidate species. Climatic refugia were located in mountains and desert fringes, remaining consistent for the Late Pleistocene-Holocene and the Plio-Pleistocene. Recurrent North-South climatic corridors were located along the desert periphery, while others less frequent were found across Central Sahara. Ancestral biogeography analyses recovered a recent Pleistocene colonization of the Sahel throughout eastern Sahara and either Sahara or Sahel origin for Central Sahara populations. Main conclusions: Species’ diversification was triggered by a combination of Plio-Pleistocene climatic cycles across a complex topographic region, where mountains acted as the main diversification hotspots. The historical role of Central Sahara highlands as main non-peripheral mesic refugia was corroborated. In addition, intermittent climatic connections linked Mediterranean and Sahel ecoregions with Central Sahara refugia, suggesting the existence of alternative trans-Sahara dispersal routes to the putative coastal and Nile corridors. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",arid mountains; biodiversity refugium; climatic cycles; cryptic diversity; dispersal corridor; historical biogeography; North Africa; phylogeography; Pliocene-Pleistocene,biogeography; colonization; data; dispersal; lizard; Africa; Arabian Peninsula; Central Department; Nile Valley; Nile [Uganda]; North Africa; Sahara; Sahel; Acanthodactylus boskianus; Lacertidae; Squamata; Vertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114866252,,TRUE,

Species paleo-range projections are emerging as a means to broaden understanding of range shifts and could be applied to assist in attribution. Apparent recent range contraction in the Quiver Tree (Aloidendron dichotomum (Masson) Klopper and Gideon F.Sm) has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change, but this has been challenged. We simulated the paleo- and future geographic range of A. dichotomum under changing climate using species distribution models (SDMs) to provide a broader perspective on its range dynamics. Ensemble modelling of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), mid-Holocene, current, and projected 2070 time periods simulates a paleo-historical poleward expansion of suitable bioclimatic space for this species under natural climate change post-LGM, and projects an eastward shift towards 2070. During the LGM, suitable bioclimatic space for A. dichotomum was simulated to be restricted to the equatorward part of its current range. During the Pleistocene/mid-Holocene climate transition period, the species’ range is predicted to have expanded significantly polewards at an average rate of 0.4 km per decade, assuming constant tracking of its optimal climatic niche. By 2070, suitable bioclimatic space is projected to expand further eastward into the summer rainfall region of South Africa, and contract in its equatorward reaches. Simulated post-LGM shifts roughly match expectations based on preliminary phylogenetic information, further supporting the attribution of current population declines to anthropogenic climate change drivers. Equatorward populations are required to migrate south-eastwards at a rate roughly 15 times faster than that calculated for the LGM/mid-Holocene climate transition period to avoid local extirpation. A preliminary analysis of range-wide genetic variation reveals a cline of variation, with generally higher levels in the central and more northerly part of the species distribution, as expected from the proposed paleo-range of the species. A more detailed analysis of the species’ phylogeographic history could be used to test the proposed paleo-range dynamics presented here, and if confirmed, would provide strong support for the use of this species as an indicator of anthropogenic climate change and a powerful case study for testing the implementation of conservation actions. © Copyright © 2021 Brodie, Grey, Bishop and Midgley.",climate change; genetic variation; Last Glacial Maximum; mid-Holocene; migration; range dynamics; species distribution modelling,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117161938,,TRUE,

Ecological niche models (ENM) and biogeographic inferences are often used in estimating the effects of climatic oscillations on species range dynamics. ENMs can be used to track climatic suitable areas over time, but have often been limited to shallow timescales; biogeographic inference can reach greater evolutionary depth, but often lacks spatial resolution. Here, we present a simple approach that treats them as independent and complementary sources of evidence, which, when used in partnership, can be employed to reconstruct geographic range shifts over deep evolutionary timescales. For testing this, we chose two extreme African disjunctions: Camptoloma (Scrophulariaceae) and Canarina (Campanulaceae), each comprising of three species disjunctly distributed in Macaronesia and eastern/southern Africa. Using inferred ancestral ranges in tandem with preindustrial and paleoclimate ENM hindcastings, we show that the disjunct pattern was the result of fragmentation and extinction events linked to Neogene aridification cycles. Our results highlight the importance of considering temporal resolution when building ENMs for rare endemics with small population sizes and restricted climatic tolerances such as Camptoloma, for which models built on averaged monthly variables were more informative than those based on annual bioclimatic variables. Additionally, we show that biogeographic information can be used as truncation threshold criteria for building ENMs in the distant past. Our approach is suitable when there is sparse sampling on species occurrences and associated patterns of genetic variation, such as in the case of ancient endemics with widely disjunct distributions as a result of climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Culshaw, Mairal and Sanmartín.",biogeographic reconstruction; deep-time climate change; ecological niche model; geographic disjunction; Rand Flora; temporal resolution; truncation threshold criteria,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116870412,,TRUE,

Successful attempts at biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of biodiversity patterns as well as the drivers and processes that determine those patterns. To deepen this knowledge, neoecologists have focused on studying present-day or recent historical data, while paleoecologists usually study long-term data through the composition of various biological proxies and environmental indicators. By establishing standard protocols or gathering databases, research infrastructures (RIs) have been instrumental to foster exchange and collaboration among scientists within neoecology (e.g. Global Information Biodiversity Facility or National Ecological Observatory Network) and paleoecology (e.g. Paleobiology Database, Neotoma Paleoecology Database or European Pollen Database). However, these two subdisciplines (and their RIs) have traditionally remained segregated although both provide valuable information that combined can improve our understanding of biodiversity drivers and underlying processes, as well as our predictions of biodiversity responses in the future. For instance, integrative studies between paleo- and neoecology have addressed the global challenge of biodiversity loss by validating climate and ecological models, estimating species fundamental niches, understanding ecological changes and trajectories, or establishing baseline conditions for restoration. Supporting and contributing to research infrastructures from both paleo- and neoecology, as well as their further integration, could boost the amount and improve the quality of such integrative studies. We argue this will enable improved capabilities to anticipate the impacts of global change and biodiversity losses. To boost such integration and illustrate our arguments, we (1) review studies integrating paleo- and neoecology to advance in the light of global changes challenge, (2) describe RIs developed in paleoecology, and (3) discuss opportunities for further integration of RIs from both disciplines (i.e. paleo- and neoecology). © 2021 The Author(s).",Biodiversity loss; Climate change; Environmental change; Global changes; Neoecology; Paleoecology; Research infrastructures,Climate models; Conservation; Database systems; Ecology; Integration; Anthropogenic pressures; Base-line conditions; Biodiversity conservation; Biodiversity patterns; Ecological changes; Environmental indicators; Global informations; Research infrastructure; Biodiversity; baseline conditions; biodiversity; conservation management; environmental restoration; future prospect; global change; infrastructure; long-term change; paleoecology; research work; Neotoma,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114477405,,TRUE,

By surveying the entire proboscidean fossil history using model-based approaches, we show that the dramatic Miocene explosion of proboscidean functional diversity was triggered by their biogeographical expansion beyond Africa. Ecomorphological innovations drove niche differentiation; communities that accommodated several disparate proboscidean species in sympatry became commonplace. The first burst of extinctions took place in the late Miocene, approximately 7 million years ago (Ma). Importantly, this and subsequent extinction trends showed high ecomorphological selectivity and went hand in hand with palaeoclimate dynamics. The global extirpation of proboscideans began escalating from 3 Ma with further extinctions in Eurasia and then a dramatic increase in African extinctions at 2.4 Ma. Overhunting by humans may have served as a final double jeopardy in the late Pleistocene after climate-triggered extinction trends that began long before hominins evolved suitable hunting capabilities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,Africa; animal; fossil; hominid; human; Africa; Animals; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109257143,,TRUE,

However, economic incentives supporting commercialization and deployment of BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) are missing. This Policy and Practice Review discusses five different models for creating incentives and financing for BECCS, using Sweden as an example: (1) governmental guarantees for purchasing BECCS outcomes; (2) quota obligation on selected sectors to acquire BECCS outcomes; (3) allowing BECCS credits to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions within the EU ETS; (4) private entities for voluntary compensation; and (5) other states acting as buyers of BECCS outcomes to meet their mitigation targets under the Paris Agreement. We conclude that successful implementation of BECCS is likely to require a combination of several of the Policy Models, implemented in a sequential manner. The governmental guarantee model (Model 1) is likely to be required in the shorter term, so as to establish BECCS. Policy Models 2 and 3 may become more influential over time once BECCS has been established and accepted. Model 3 links BECCS to a large carbon-pricing regime with opportunities for cost-effectiveness and expanded financing. We conclude that Policy Models 4 and 5 are associated with high levels of uncertainty regarding the timing and volume of negative emissions that can be expected—Thus, they are unlikely to trigger BECCS implementation in the short term, although may have roles in the longer term. Based on this study, we recommend that policymakers carefully consider a policy sequencing approach that is predictable and sustainable over time, for which further analyses are required. It is not obvious how such sequencing can be arranged, as the capacities to implement the different Policy Models are vested in different organizations (national governments, EU, private firms). Furthermore, it is important that a BECCS policy is part of an integrated climate policy framework, in particular one that is in line with policies aimed at the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the creation of a circular economy. It will be important to ensure that BECCS and the associated biomass resource are not overexploited. A well-designed policy package should guarantee that BECCS is neither used to postpone the reduction of fossil fuel-based emissions nor overused in the short term as a niche business for “greenwashing” while not addressing fossil fuel emissions.

In addition, organisms at different latitudes may be differentially susceptible to climate change. Here, we tracked the seed dispersal of Acer caudatifolium using chloroplast DNA to explore the relationships of terrain and local climate heterogeneity with range shifts and demography in Taiwan. Our results showed that the extant populations have shifted upward and northward to the mountains since the Last Glacial Maximum. The distributional upshift of A. caudatifolium is in contrast to the downward expansion of its closest relative in Taiwan, A. morrisonense. The northern populations of A. caudatifolium have acquired multiple-source chloro-types and harbor high genetic diversity. However, effective gene flow between the north and south is interrupted by topography, geographic distance, north-south differences in October rainfall, and other climate heterogeneities, blocking southward genetic rescue. In addition, winter monsoon-driven rainfall may cause regional differences in the phenological schedule, resulting in adaptive effects on the timing of range shift and the genetic draft of chlorotype distribution. Terrain, distance, and local climate also differentiate the northernmost populations from the others, supporting the previous taxonomic treatment of Acer kawakamii var. taitonmontanum as an independent variety. © 2021 by the authors.

Hence, construction materials from renewable resources are expected to have a large potential to decrease these impacts. In this study, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted for four different insulation materials from renewable feedstock: insulation made from pasture grass, seaweed, reed, and recycled jute fibres. Additionally, the effects on land use change were evaluated for pasture grass insulation using the LANCA® methodology. To put the LCA results in relation to those of non-renewable resources, a comparison of standardized LCA values for conventional insulation materials is presented. In general, the renewable insulation materials show fewer environmental impacts than their conventional counterparts. In particular, these materials have advantages regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on climate change. Of the analyzed materials, seaweed showed the overall lowest emissions. It can be concluded that insulation materials from non-mineral, non-fossil, and non-wooden resources are still fairly niche in terms of market share, but they have extraordinary potential in decreasing the environmental impacts of construction ventures. © 2021 by the authors.

(ii) Does tree community taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover respond to paleoclimate (Last Glacial Maximum and Mid-Holocene)? Methods: The study was carried out in 14 Atlantic rainforest sites in Brazil (20.4 ha sampled) containing 615 tree species from 83 plant families. We obtained plot-level geographic coordinates and soil variables and site-level bioclimatic variables in the current, Mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum. We used structural equation models with a distance-based approach to (i) test the direct effects of spatial distance and environmental dissimilarity and (ii) test the indirect effects of spatial distance via environmental dissimilarity on taxonomic (Bray-Curtis distance) and phylogenetic turnover (Comdist and Comdistnt distances). Important Findings: Our results suggest a weak indirect effect of spatial distance via environmental dissimilarity on taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover. Tree community turnover was driven by the direct effects of neutral, niche-based and historical processes. Thus, we inferred that the paleoclimate (historical processes) promoted the selection of the clades that gave rise to the current flora, while spatial distances (neutral processes) limited the dispersal range of species from the regional pool and environmental conditions (niche-based processes) locally selected the taxa that are able to persist. © 2021 The Author(s).

Traditionally, this area has been seen as a transition zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical regions; in contrast, new data suggest that Mesoamerica is a centre of origin and taxonomic diversification. For example, the diversity of species and genera of Passalidae in Mesoamerica is concentrated in montane environments and there are many locally endemic taxa; thus, Mesoamerica has been suggested as a centre of origin and taxonomic diversification for the group. However, this hypothesis has not been formally tested. Location: New World tropics, with an emphasis on Mesoamerica. Taxon: Coleoptera, Passalidae (tribes Passalini and Proculini). Methods: We studied timing and geographic patterns in the taxonomic diversification of Neotropical Passalidae. We used DNA sequence data from 3 genes (CAD, Wingless, 28S) for 93 species of Passalidae, along with information from the fossil record, to generate a time-calibrated phylogeny for the group. Additionally, we performed Ancestral Area Estimation and Ancestral State Reconstruction of the altitudinal distribution niche. Results: The divergence time analyses recovered a much older estimated timing of origin and diversification events in Passalidae than previously proposed. We recovered the origins of the New World Passalidae in the late Jurassic and the split between Passalini and Proculini during the mid-Cretaceous. Moreover, we observed congruence between timing and patterns of clade diversification and major paleogeographical events; for example, the origin and crown diversification of montane genera during the uplift and emergence of Mesoamerica from the sea. Main conclusions: Orogenic events throughout the Paleogene and Neogene played a major role in the diversification of New World Passalidae. Moreover, Nuclear and Southern Mesoamerica are centres of origin and taxonomic diversification for Proculini. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",endemism; historical biogeography; Mesoamerica; montane diversification,endemism; fauna; montane forest; Nearctic Region; Neotropical Region; niche; paleogeography; phylogeny; species diversity; species richness; Coleoptera; Passalidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105651698,,FALSE,

Therefore, decarbonisation of ammonia production is of high relevance towards achieving a carbon neutral energy system. This study investigates the global potential of green ammonia production from semi-flexible ammonia plants utilising a cost-optimised configuration of hybrid PV-wind power plants, as well as conversion and balancing technologies. The global weather data used is on an hourly time scale and 0.45° × 0.45° spatial resolution. The results show that, by 2030, solar PV would be the dominating electricity generation technology in most parts of the world, and the role of batteries would be limited, while no significant role is found for hydrogen-fuelled gas turbines. Green ammonia could be generated at the best sites in the world for a cost range of 440–630, 345–420, 300–330 and 260–290 €/tNH3 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively, for a weighted average capital cost of 7%. Comparing this to the decade-average fossil-based ammonia cost of 300–350 €/t, green ammonia could become cost-competitive in niche markets by 2030, and substitute fossil-based ammonia globally at current cost levels. A possible cost decline of natural gas and consequently fossil-based ammonia could be fully neutralised by greenhouse gas emissions cost of about 75 €/tCO2 by 2040. By 2040, green ammonia in China would be lower in cost than ammonia from new coal-based plants, even at the lowest coal prices and no greenhouse gas emissions cost. The difference in green ammonia production at the least-cost sites in the world's nine major regions is less than 50 €/tNH3 by 2040. Thus, ammonia shipping cost could limit intercontinental trading and favour local or regional production beyond 2040. © 2020 The Authors",Battery; Energy economics; Hybrid PV–wind; Power-based chemicals; Power-to-Ammonia (PtA); Power-to-X,Commerce; Costs; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Natural gasoline plants; Solar power generation; Wind power; Ammonia production; Ammonia-based; Emission costs; Energy economics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hybrid PV–wind; Power-based chemical; Power-to-ammonia; Power-to-X; Wind power plants; Ammonia; ammonia; electricity generation; global perspective; optimization; photovoltaic system; power plant; wind power; China,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097074880,,FALSE,

The diversity record of life is littered with examples of declines and radiations, yet no species has ever re-evolved following its true extinction. In contrast, functional traits can transcend diversity declines, often develop iteratively and are taxon-free allowing application across taxa, environments and time. Planktonic foraminifera have an unrivaled, near continuous fossil record for the past 200 million years making them a perfect test organism to understand trait changes through time, but the functional role of morphology in determining habitat occupation has been questioned. Here, we use single specimen stable isotopes to reconstruct the water depth habitat of individual planktonic foraminifera in the genus Subbotina alongside morphological measurements of the tests to understand trait changes through the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum [MECO: ∼40 Myr ago (mega annum, Ma)]. The MECO is a geologically transient global warming interval that marks the beginning of widespread biotic reorganizations in marine organisms spanning a size spectrum from diatoms to whales. In contrast to other planktonic foraminiferal genera, the subbotinids flourished through this interval despite multiple climatic perturbations superimposed on a changing background climate. Through coupled trait and geochemical analysis, we show that Subbotina survival through this climatically dynamic interval was aided by trait plasticity and a wider ecological niche than previously thought for a subthermocline dwelling genus supporting a generalist life strategy. We also show how individually resolved oxygen isotopes can track shifts in depth occupancy through climatic upheaval. During and following the MECO, temperature changes were substantial in the thermocline and subthermocline in comparison to the muted responses of the surface ocean. In our post-MECO samples, we observe restoration of planktonic foraminifera depth stratification. Despite these changing temperatures and occupied depths, we do not detect a contemporaneous morphological response implying that readily available traits such as test size and shape do not have a clear functional role in this generalist genus. Modern imaging measurement technologies offer a promising route to gather more informative morphological traits for functional analysis, rather than the traditional candidates that are most easily measured. © Copyright © 2021 Kearns, Bohaty, Edgar, Nogué and Ezard.",ecological niches; functional trait; paleoclimate; paleoecology; planktonic foraminifera,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111076339,,FALSE,

This study investigated the influences of paleoclimate changes on the present disjunct distribution formation of Pinus koraiensis (Korean pine) using species distribution modeling. A species distribution model (SDM) was built using maximum entropy principle algorithms (MaxEnt), data from 152 occurrences of the species, and four bioclimatic variables at 2.5 arcminute (approximately 5 km) spatial resolution. The simulation revealed the excellent fit of the MaxEnt model performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.922 and continuous Boyce index (BCI) value of 0.925 with fivefold cross-validation. The most important climatic factor was the minimum temperature of the coldest month. Suitable habitats for the species ranged between − 30.1 and − 4.1 °C. Projected suitable habitats under the Last Glacial Maximum (approximately 22,000 years ago [ka BP]: LGM) period showed wide distributions in eastern China, the southern part of the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese Archipelago. After the mid-Holocene (approximately 6 ka BP), the suitable habitats expanded northwards in continental regions and retreated from both north and southwest of Japan. This eventually formed disjunct suitable habitats in central Japan. An increase in temperature after the LGM period caused the migration of P. koraiensis toward new, suitable habitats in continental Northeast Asia, while species in the Japanese Archipelago retreated, forming the present disjunct distributions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Climate change; Disjunct distribution; Macro fossil; Northeast Asia; Quaternary; Species distribution model,climate effect; climate variation; disjunct distribution; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; maximum entropy analysis; migration; paleoclimate; pine; species occurrence; Asia; China; Japan; Korea; Northeast Asia; Pinus koraiensis,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107514102,,TRUE,

Previous studies have associated the extinction of the species ∼14,000 calendar years before present to climatic and vegetational changes, suggesting the later survival of populations in north-east Siberia may have related to the later persistence of open vegetation in the region. Here, we analyzed carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotopes and mitochondrial DNA sequences to elucidate the evolutionary ecology of the species. Our dataset comprised 286 woolly rhinoceros isotopic records, including 192 unpublished records, from across the species range, dating from &gt;58,600 to 12,135 14C years before present (equivalent to 14,040 calendar years ago).

In north-east Siberia, we detected stability in δ15N through time, which could reflect long-term environmental stability, and may have enabled the later survival of the species in the region. To further investigate the paleoecology of woolly rhinoceroses, we compared their isotopic compositions with other contemporary herbivores. Our findings suggested isotopic similarities between woolly rhinoceros and both musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) and saiga (Saiga tatarica), albeit at varying points in time, and possible niche partitioning between woolly rhinoceros and both horse (Equus spp.) and woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). To provide phylogeographic context to the isotopic data, we compiled and analyzed the 61 published mitochondrial control region sequences. The genetic data showed a lack of geographic structuring; we found three haplogroups with overlapping distributions, all of which showed a signal of expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum. Furthermore, our genetic findings support the notion that environmental stability in Siberia influenced the paleoecology of woolly rhinoceroses in the region. Our study highlights the utility of combining stable isotopic records with ancient DNA to advance our knowledge of the evolutionary ecology of past populations and extinct species. © 2021 The Authors",Ancient DNA; Coelodonta antiquitatis; Late pleistocene; Mitochondrial DNA; Paleoecology; Stable isotopes; Woolly rhinoceros,DNA; DNA sequences; Ecology; Stability; $+15$/N; Ancient DNA; Coelodonta antiquitati; Isotopic record; Late Pleistocene; Mitochondrial DNA; North-East Siberia; Palaeoecology; Stable isotopes; Wooly rhinoceros; Isotopes; data set; DNA; geographical variation; Last Glacial Maximum; mammal; mammoth; mitochondrial DNA; niche partitioning; paleoecology; phylogeography; Pleistocene; stable isotope; survival; Europe; Siberia; Coelodonta antiquitatis; Mammuthus primigenius; Ovibos moschatus; Rhinocerotidae; Saiga tatarica,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106378999,,FALSE,

Although common in ecology, this effect is rarely discussed in population genetics. Here, we use genetic markers to reveal population genetic patterns and also test the mountain- and sky-barrier hypotheses relevant to the Massenerhebung distribution pattern of Acer morrisonense in Taiwan's rugged topography and varied local climates. Location: The alpine and cloud forest of Taiwan. Taxon: Acer morrisonense Hayata. Methods: Two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments and 17 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) loci, respectively, from 200 to 286 individuals were used to elucidate the phylogeographic pattern of pollen and seed dispersal of A. morrisonense. These data were combined with ecological niche modeling (ENM) to infer distribution range shifts and refugia. We also correlated the genetic-divergence indices with spatial factors to clarify latitudinal and altitudinal effects on genetic diversity. Results: The incongruent phylogeographic patterns of genetic distributions between nuclear and cpDNA markers indicate unhindered pollen flow but spatially constrained seed dispersal. Taken together with ENM, the genetic pattern further reflects historical colonization from central-mountain refugia to edges since the Holocene. The Massenerhebung reduces the gene flow by the surrounding mountains and also causes lower genetic diversity compared to central alpine populations. Main conclusions: This study is the first to reveal the influence of Massenerhebung effect on cpDNA genetic structure of montane trees and reflect the spatial trends of seed dispersal. This population genetic pattern can also be attributed to the demography-related range shifts with paleoclimate fluctuations under complex mountain topography, supporting the mountain-barrier hypothesis. The results have important implications for conserving the genetic diversity of species with a wide altitudinal distribution range. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",barrier; generalized additive model; Holocene Thermal optimum; maple; mass elevation effect; pollen-to-seed migration ratio; Sapindaceae; winter monsoon,altitude; cloud forest; colonization; demography; dicotyledon; ecological modeling; gene flow; genetic marker; genetic structure; genetic variation; paleoclimate; population genetics; seed dispersal; topography; Taiwan; Sapindaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103415013,,TRUE,

We use directly radiocarbon dated bones of introduced dogs (Canis familiaris) to test whether dogs could have aided human-led hunts of the island’s extinct megafauna. We compare carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone collagen of dogs and endemic “fosa” (Cryptoprocta spp.) in central and southwestern Madagascar to test for competition between introduced and endemic predators. The distinct isotopic niches of dogs and fosa suggest that any past antagonistic relationship between these predators did not follow from predation or competition for shared prey. Radiocarbon dates confirm that dogs have been present on Madagascar for over a millennium and suggest that they at least briefly co-occurred with the island’s extinct megafauna, which included giant lemurs, elephant birds, and pygmy hippopotamuses. Today, dogs share a mutualism with pastoralists who also occasionally hunt endemic vertebrates, and similar behavior is reflected in deposits at several Malagasy paleontological sites that contain dog and livestock bones along with butchered bones of extinct megafauna and extant lemurs. Dogs on Madagascar have had a wide range of diets during the past millennium, but relatively high stable carbon isotope values suggest few individuals relied primarily on forest bushmeat.

Indeed, the establishment of an efficient biological pump was likely a key factor enabling the diversification of animals over 500 Myr ago during the Cambrian explosion. The modern biological pump operates through two main vectors: the passive sinking of aggregates of organic matter, and the active vertical migration of animals. The coevolution of eukaryotes and sinking aggregates is well understood for the Proterozoic and Cambrian; however, little attention has been paid to the establishment of the vertical migration of animals. Here we investigate the morphological variation and hydrodynamic performance of the Cambrian euarthropod Isoxys. We combine elliptical Fourier analysis of carapace shape with computational fluid dynamics simulations to demonstrate that Isoxys species likely occupied a variety of niches in Cambrian oceans, including vertical migrants, providing the first quantitative evidence that some Cambrian animals were adapted for vertical movement in the water column.

Fauna, and the humans that preyed on them, were forced to adapt their behaviours in response to climate changes to survive. The Cantabrian Region of northern Spain was continuously inhabited during this period when many other areas of Europe were inhospitable. The site of Las Caldas (Asturias) was repeatedly occupied by hunter-gatherers during the Solutrean (26.1–20.3 kyr cal BP) and Magdalenian (18.5–14.3 kyr cal BP). This paper uses δ13C and δ15N stable isotope analysis of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) remains to reconstruct past environments, ungulate niches and habitats, and to understand how this impacted on their availability as a prey source. Results show that during the Solutrean, cold and potentially wet LGM conditions were experienced and ibex lived in lower altitudes, likely due to reduced vegetation, and even small glaciers on the higher mountain slopes. Improved environmental conditions in the Magdalenian allowed ibex to live in their preferred habitat of higher altitudes. Ameliorated Late Glacial conditions correspond with changing economic hunting strategies at the site. Humans exploited wider ecological zones, over larger distances, which coincides with population growth, and greater connectivity across the Cantabrian region.

The evolutionary history and past distribution patterns of the giant panda remain poorly understood. Our aim was to integratively apply distinct methods to evaluate the evolutionary history and distributional patterns of the giant panda; these included phylogeography, ecological niche modeling (ENM), and fossil data. To this end, we characterized the panda's past and present ecological niches and the environmental conditions that define them. To estimate the panda's phylogeographic patterns and the environmental conditions (precipitation and temperature) available across its historical geographic range, we evaluated its past distribution during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Considering that modeling biotic interactions (e.g., foraging, predation) is still an enormous challenge, we propose a novel modeling strategy based on the panda's specialized diet, using an ensemble of three bamboo genera with distribution across the panda's historical geographic range. Finally, we tested the accuracy of our approach by evaluating its ability to predict the LGM fossils. Our results support that the panda's diversification across its distribution happened ca. 2.7 million years (Mya), coinciding with the likely period when the panda changed from a carnivorous to a vegetarian diet (from the Pleistocene to the Pliocene), acquiring its exclusively bamboo-feeding habits until the mid-Holocene. Our findings provide evidence of a historical directional niche change along which the panda has currently reached the lower limits of temperature and precipitation conditions existing on the geography where its food is available. Our proposed ENM based on the panda's food habits accurately predicted 85.7% of the LGM fossils, in stark contrast with the traditional approach of modeling the distribution of species by using exclusively its own occurrences. These results provide insights on how to include Eltonian components to undertake more robust ENM when only abiotic variables are available. We emphasize the importance of integrating fossil information, whenever available, into the niche modeling process to include the historical component when estimating species ecological niches. © 2021 The Author(s).",bears; ecological niche modeling; filoclimaespacio; filogeografía; fossils; fósiles; modelización del nicho ecológico; NicheRover; NicheRover; osos; phyloclimatespace; phylogeography; Ursidae; Ursidae,bamboo; ecological approach; fossil; Last Glacial Maximum; niche partitioning; Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Ursidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109216953,,TRUE,

SDMs linking fossil records have the potential to improve conservation decisions under human-induced climate change. Here, we built SDMs using presence records from contemporary and Holocene records to enable estimations of climatically suitable area under current and future climate scenarios. Location: Aotearoa New Zealand. Taxon: Tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus. Methods: For an evolutionary relict found in Aotearoa New Zealand, the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), we built SDMs using presence records from contemporary and Holocene records to estimate climatically suitable area under current and future climate scenarios. We also use our detailed knowledge of the Holocene distribution and remnant populations to examine niche shifts following the arrival of humans and associated introduction of mammalian predators. To build SDMs, we use presence records from four sources: (a) remnant populations, (b) radiocarbon-dated fossil deposits from the Holocene, (c) other fossil deposits containing tuatara bones of Holocene age and iv) islands from which tuatara are known or highly likely to have become extinct. Results: We found shifts in the niche of tuatara due to niche unfilling. Incorporating locations of Holocene deposits and/or all past locations in SDMs led to larger areas of climatically suitable area being identified compared to SDMs derived from remnant populations only. Using all presence records, under climate change projections for 2090, climatically suitable area increased slightly. However, many areas retain potential as translocation sites (e.g. northern South Island), some areas become unsuitable (e.g. inland Canterbury) and/or involve extrapolation into novel climates (e.g. Northland). Main Conclusion: SDMs incorporating locations of Holocene deposits and/or all past locations identified areas of critical habitat for tuatara under current and future climate scenarios, that would not have been identified using contemporary occurrences only. Our results highlight the need to consider past locations when assessing habitat suitability for conservation translocations, both for tuatara and other relict species. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",ecological niche model; Maxent; reintroduction; species distribution model; species redistribution; Sphenodon punctatus,climate change; conservation planning; evolutionary biology; fossil record; future prospect; geographical distribution; Holocene; human activity; knowledge; lizard; niche; relict species; Canterbury [South Island]; New Zealand; North Island; Northland; South Island; Mammalia; Sphenodon punctatus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102749519,,TRUE,

However, little is known about how paleoclimate differences shaped the biogeographic pattern and diversification history of the freshwater fauna in important zoogeographical boundary regions. Here, we aim to investigate how past regional climatic differences have shaped the biogeographic history of the inland aquatic fauna in China using an endemic freshwater crab species complex found on both sides of the Qinling Mountains–Huaihe River Line (QHL), a critical ecological boundary in eastern China, as a model system. Location: Eastern China, the Qinling Mountains–Huaihe River Line. Taxon: The Sinopotamon yangtsekiense species complex. Methods: A total of 482 individuals of Sinopotamon yangtsekiense sensu lato were collected from 34 localities throughout its entire distributional range. The phylogeographic analyses of population structure, morphological and genetic variations, and demographic dynamics were made based on multiple mtDNA and nuDNA loci and on morphological traits. Fine-tuned ecological niche modeling was used to reconstruct the location of climatically suitable areas that existed during the Last Glacial Maximum. Results: The divergence of two freshwater crab lineages across the QHL correlated with significant past variations in monsoon intensity and with the location of multiple refuges. The divergence time was broadly consistent with the timing of the critical paleoclimate transition event in the mid-Pleistocene (95% HPD, 0.48–1.06 Ma). Each freshwater crab lineage has evolved distinct male genital traits associated with their isolation in areas with different precipitation rates and temperatures in the past. The patterns of crab distribution observed today reflect past contractions of the two lineages in response to glacial and interglacial cycles during the Pleistocene, followed by their subsequent rapid expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum (~15 kya). Main conclusions: Populations of the widespread species Sinopotamon yangtsekiense s.l. experienced a deep division in the past that led to the phylogeographical isolation observed today. The two main drivers of genetic isolation in this taxon were (a) differences in the intensity of the monsoons on each side of the QHL boundary during the mid-Pleistocene, and (b) isolation of different populations of S. yangtsekiense s.l. in a number of separate refuges during the LGM. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",eastern China; freshwater crab; genital divergence; paleoclimate shift; phylogeographic structure; zoogeographical boundary,biogeography; crab; ecological modeling; freshwater environment; genetic variation; geographical distribution; Last Glacial Maximum; niche; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; regional climate; China; Huai River; Qinling Mountains; (freshwater crab); Sinopotamon yangtsekiense,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101958992,,TRUE,

Location: Mediterranean and Macaronesian. Taxon: Cupressaceae, Juniperus. Methods: Data on the occurrence of the J. phoenicea complex were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org), the literature, herbaria, and the authors’ field notes. Bioclimatic variables were obtained from the WorldClim database and Paleoclim. The climate data related to species localities were used for predictions of niches by implementation of Maxent, and the model was evaluated with ENMeval. Results: The potential niches of Juniperus phoenicea during the Last Interglacial period (LIG), Last Glacial Maximum climate (LGM), and Mid-Holocene (MH) covered 30%, 10%, and almost 100%, respectively, of the current potential niche. Climate warming may reduce potential niches by 30% in RCP2.6 and by 90% in RCP8.5. The potential niches of Juniperus turbinata had a broad circum-Mediterranean and Canarian distribution during the LIG and the MH; its distribution extended during the LGM when it was found in more areas than at present. The predicted warming in scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 could reduce the current potential niche by 30% and 50%, respectively. The model did not find suitable niches for J. canariensis during the LIG and the LGM, but during the MH its potential niche was 30% larger than at present. The climate warming scenario RCP2.6 indicates a reduction in the potential niche by 30%, while RCP8.5 so indicates a reduction of almost 60%.

Both the fossil and extant pollen grains of H. abyssinica were examined with combined light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to compare the pollen and establish their relationships. Based on this, the fossil pollen grains were attributed to Hagenia. The presence of Hagenia in the fossil assemblage raises the questions if its habitat has changed over time, and if the plants are/were wind pollinated. To shed light on these questions, the morphology of extant anthers was also studied, revealing specialized hairs inside the anthers, believed to aid in insect pollination. Pollen and anther morphology are discussed in relation to the age and origin of the genus within a molecular dated phylogenetic framework, the establishment of complex topography in East Africa, other evidence regarding pollination modes, and the palynological record. The evidence presented herein, and compiled from the literature, suggests that Hagenia was an insect-pollinated lowland rainforest element during the early Miocene of the Mush Valley. The current Afromontane habitat and ambophilous (insect and wind) pollination must have evolved in post-mid-Miocene times. © 2021 The Authors.

A particularly problematic taxon within the Geoscapheinae is Geoscapheus dilatatus (Saussure, 1864), which might represent a species complex and whose delimitation has been complicated for decades by the species harbouring polymorphic males. Males can be divided into two main morphs: individuals possessing horn-like protrusions on the anterior margin of the pronotum (‘tuberculate’) and those without these characters (‘non-tuberculate’). A less common, third form consists of individuals that possess tubercles but are far larger than other tuberculate males and occur solely to the north of the species' distribution (‘atypical’ tuberculates). Here, we make use of whole mitochondrial genomes and nuclear ribosomal RNA data from individuals across the range of G. dilatatus to conduct the first phylogenetic analysis of this species to date. We recover all tuberculate males (including atypical forms) as monophyletic and the derived form of G. dilatatus, having evolved only once in this species, whereas non-tuberculate forms are paraphyletic. Fossil-calibrated molecular clock analysis revealed that the divergence between these two forms occurred during the late Miocene approximately 6.7 Mya, concurrent with an expansion of the continent's drier biomes. Environmental niche modelling suggests that tuberculate male forms are more climatically tolerant than their more restricted non-tuberculate counterparts, and both forms' predicted fundamental niches are strongly limited by rainfall. Three species delimitation analyses implemented here failed to consistently delimit G. dilatatus beyond a single species. Ultimately, population genetic approaches paired with additional sampling will be necessary to determine these findings more concretely, but at present, we do not consider the results presented here sufficient to delimit G. dilatatus based on morphological differences found in the species' polymorphic males alone. © 2021 Australian Entomological Society",biogeography; Blaberidae; Blattodea; environmental niche modelling; Geoscapheinae; sexual dimorphism; systematics,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101200931,,TRUE,?

Fossil-based inputs in the chemical, textile, apparel and downstream industries can be replaced by lignocellulose-based products such as dissolving pulp, cellulose-based chemical derivatives and textile fibres. When looking ahead, these previous niche products are likely to gain in economic importance. So far, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of macroeconomic relations of emerging lignocellulose-based materials on macroeconomic level. Key economic parameters for such materials are not available neither at regional nor at global level. This work aims to contribute to a better understanding of the market behavior of emerging forest products that are not yet covered by forest products market analysis. Therefore, this paper investigates how lignocellulose-based products respond to changes of main economic drivers and compute global market elasticities for dissolving pulp, cellulose-based chemical derivatives and textile fibres. To conduct our evaluation, we first test historical input data for non-constancy in time series due to structural changes using change-point estimator (MOSUM test). We subsequently carry out a global econometric analysis of demand and supply elasticities with income (GDP) and real import and export prices as explanatory variables. By doing so, we deliver key information for the adaptation of forest-product market analysis and modelling to an upcoming bioeconomy. The results show several structural changes especially in price data between 1992 and 2015, thus supporting the use of time series cuts to divide the time line from 1992 to 2015 into three different sub-periods. Elasticities are subsequently estimated for each of the sub-periods. The results from this econometric analysis provide import demand and export supply elasticities of dissolving pulp, cellulose chemical derivatives and cellulose textile fibres. In addition, we present elasticity estimation for the apparent consumption of dissolving pulp. Our findings outline the significant relationship between both export supply and import demand volumes and relative changes in prices and income. Across time periods, elasticities of cellulose-based derivatives and textile fibres do not show a clear trend towards more elastic or inelastic coefficients. However, the price elasticities of dissolving pulp fluctuate strongly from inelastic to highly elastic over time. Elasticity estimates of export supply indicate that it is sensitive to international competitiveness which in turn is governed by international demand. Finally, we statistically show that the estimated price and income elasticities of import demand can be analogously interpreted as the demand elasticity of apparent consumption. This is of great importance for economic equilibrium models, such as GFPM or EFI-GTM, in order to simulate and analyze forest sector developments and scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bioeconomy; Cellulose-based Forest products; Elasticities; Forest products market modelling; Panel data econometrics,Bioeconomy; Cellulose; Chemical analysis; Costs; Dissolution; Economic analysis; Elasticity; Forestry; International trade; Lignin; Textile fibers; Textile industry; Textiles; Time series; Change point estimator; Demand elasticities; Econometric analysis; Economic equilibrium; Elasticity estimation; Explanatory variables; International competitiveness; International demand; Competition; Cellulose; Chemical Analysis; Costs; Dissolving; Economic Analysis; Elasticity,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101169062,,FALSE,

Here we address several biogeographical hypotheses by combining intense geographical and genomic sampling obtained for the Brazilian sibilator frog. We specifically test predictions related to the putative roles of past climate shifts (Pleistocene and Holocene) and local geographical barriers (past and current courses of the São Francisco River, SFR) in causing population differentiation in this species. Location: Caatinga and eastern Cerrado. Taxon: Brazilian sibilator frog Leptodactylus troglodytes. Methods: We sequenced up to ~15,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms for 159 samples from 61 locations. We inferred genetic structure using spatial clustering and examined population sizes through time. We estimated the relationship among populations using phylogenetic reconstruction, estimated historical distributions with ecological niche modelling and inferred demographic history under isolation-with-migration models. Results: Genetic diversity in L. troglodytes corresponds to biome boundaries, with one population in the Cerrado and two populations in the Caatinga, separated by the SFR. Demographic model selection indicates the Caatinga populations expanded since the end of the Pleistocene while the Cerrado population declined. Within the Caatinga, population expansion began earlier and was more extreme in the north. A continuous stability area maintained the two Caatinga populations, which share a common origin and began diverging in the mid-Pleistocene, first with symmetric gene flow and later under pronounced migration from the north. Main conclusions: We could not reject a role of past climate change in causing diversification of relictual populations in the Cerrado, but we found no evidence of multiple refuges or long-term isolation within the Caatinga. Instead, diversification in this biome appears to be caused by the SFR acting as a ‘soft barrier’ that constrains migration over an extended period of time. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Caatinga; Cerrado; historical demography; Leptodactylus troglodytes; Neotropical diversification; São Francisco River,arid region; biogeographical region; biome; caatinga; cerrado; demographic history; ecological modeling; frog; gene flow; genetic structure; genomics; Holocene; Neotropical Region; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; regionalization; Brazil; Sao Francisco River; Leptodactylus troglodytes; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; Troglodytes; Troglodytes troglodytes; Troglodytes troglodytes troglodytes,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100964246,,TRUE,

In order to determine the impact of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on the tropical rain forests of western Ecuador, we explored the evolutionary history of the endemic palm Phytelephas aequatorialis. Location: Western Ecuador, north-western South America. Taxon: Phytelephas aequatorialis (Arecaceae). Methods: One hundred and seventy-six nuclear genes were sequenced in 91 individuals for phylogenomic and population structure analyses. The time of divergence between identified genetic lineages was estimated using a coalescent phylogenomic analysis. Palaeoecological niche modelling analyses were performed to determine areas of historical climatic suitability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 22 ka) that potentially acted as forest refugia during the Pleistocene. A Wilcoxon test and Pearson correlations were used to explore how current levels of genetic diversity, in terms of expected heterozygosity (Hs), have been shaped by several palaeoclimatic and geographic factors. Results: Phylogenomic and population structure analyses revealed two main genetic lineages with a north–south distribution, which diverged 1.14 Ma during the Pleistocene. Two potential Pleistocene refugia were identified, one along the Pacific coast of Ecuador and one in the Andean foothills of south-western Ecuador. The location of these refugia agrees with the spatial location of the two genetic lineages. Within the Andean foothills, Hs was lower for the southern lineage than for the northern lineage. Hs significantly increased with decreasing latitude across the species as a whole. Main conclusions: Pleistocene climatic fluctuations promoted intraspecific divergence in P. aequatorialis within the rain forests of western Ecuador. The Andean foothills of south-western Ecuador could be an important area for rain forest evolution because they potentially remained climatically suitable throughout the Pleistocene. Lower genetic diversity in the southern lineage, which apparently remained isolated in the Andean foothills during glacial cycles, adds evidence to the presence of a forest refugium in south-western Ecuador. The geographic pattern in genetic diversity suggests that P. aequatorialis colonized western Ecuador from the north. This study supports the role of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations in promoting intraspecific divergence, and for the first time, we show their impact west of the Andes. © 2021 The Authors.

While morphology provides approximations of diets, stable isotope proxies provide insights into the realized diets of animals. We present a synthesis of the isotopic ecologies (δ 13 C from tooth enamel) of North American mammalian herbivores since approximately 7 Ma. We ask: (i) do morphological interpretations of dietary behaviour agree with stable isotope proxy data? (ii) are grazing taxa specialists, or is grazing a means to broaden the dietary niche? and (iii) how is dietary niche breadth attained in taxa at the local level? We demonstrate that while brachydont taxa are specialized as browsers, hypsodont taxa often have broader diets that included more browse consumption than previously anticipated. It has long been accepted that morphology imposes limits on the diet; this synthesis supports prior work that herbivores with 'grazing' adaptions, such as hypsodont teeth, have the ability to consume grass but are also able to eat other foods. Notably, localized dietary breadth of even generalist taxa can be narrow (approx. 30 to 60% of a taxon's overall breadth). This synthesis demonstrates that 'grazing-adapted' taxa are varied in their diets across space and time, and this flexibility may reduce competition among ancient herbivores. © 2021 The Authors.",ecology; herbivore; niche; stable isotope analysis,carbon isotope; diet; grass; habitat selection; herbivore; mammal; morphology; paleoecology; phenotypic plasticity; specialization; stable isotope; Mammalia; carbon; animal; diet; ecosystem; fossil; herbivory; United States; Animals; Carbon Isotopes; Diet; Ecosystem; Fossils; Herbivory; United States,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104307328,,FALSE,

However, no currently published reports dating to >200 ka can be confidently attributed to E. grevyi, with most specimens better allocated to another taxon or lacking diagnostic characteristics aligning them with E. grevyi to the exclusion of other large Equus species such as E. oldowayensis. This leaves the origin of Grévy's zebra unresolved. Here, we describe a largely complete cranium of a large mare from the Kapthurin Formation in Kenya's Baringo Basin that represents the first definitive appearance of E. grevyi at 547.0–392.6 ka. This cranium falls within the range of variation for recent E. grevyi and is morphologically distinct from all other fossil and extant zebras. The new Kapthurin specimen has implications for the complex evolutionary history of large zebras. Furthermore, it provides insights into the mechanisms underpinning the expanded range of Grévy's zebra during the Pleistocene. Based on species distribution modeling and a multivariate analysis of its climate niche, we argue that the wide fossil distribution of E. grevyi may have had little to do with Pleistocene aridity as previously argued. Instead, the range contraction of Grévy's zebra may have been driven by competition with plains zebra (E. quagga) after the northward expansion of the latter species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Baringo basin; Biogeography; Eastern Africa; Equidae; Paleoclimate; Paleodistributions,Geology; Natural sciences; Evolutionary history; Geographic ranges; Middle Pleistocene; Multi variate analysis; Paleoecology; Pleistocene; Species distribution modeling; Multivariant analysis; aridity; biostratigraphy; cranium; evolution; fossil record; multivariate analysis; new record; paleoecology; Pleistocene; ungulate; Baringo; Kenya; Equidae; Equus grevyi,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100819779,,TRUE,

Historical legacy effects and the mechanisms underlying cyanobacterial community succession are not well understood, especially for plateau lakes that are important global freshwater resources. This study investigated the temporal dynamics of cyanobacterial communities over centuries in response to nutrient enrichment and climate warming in low-latitude plateau lakes using high-Throughput DNA sequencing of sedimentary DNA combined with traditional paleolimnological analyses. Our results confirmed that nutrients and climate warming drive shifts in cyanobacterial communities over time. Cyanobacterial community turnover was pronounced with regime shifts toward new ecological states, occurring after exceeding a tipping point of aquatic total phosphorus (TP). The inferred species interactions, niche differentiation, and identity of keystone taxa significantly changed after crossing the aquatic TP ecological threshold, as demonstrated by network analysis of cyanobacterial taxa. Further, the contribution of aquatic TP to cyanobacterial community dynamics was greater than that of air temperature when lakes were in an oligotrophic state. In contrast, as the aquatic TP threshold was exceeded, the contribution to community dynamics by air temperature increased and potentially surpassed that of aquatic TP. Overall, these results provide new evidence for how past nutrient levels in lacustrine ecosystems influence contemporary cyanobacterial community responses to global warming in low-latitude plateau lakes. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

Their record extends from the Eocene to the late Pleistocene. Four genera and eight species are currently recognised, with diversity highest in the Miocene. Dromornithids were once consid-ered ratites, but since the discovery of cranial elements, phylogenetic analyses have placed them near the base of the anseriforms or, most recently, resolved them as stem galliforms. In this study, we use morphometric methods to comprehensively describe dromornithid endocranial morphology for the first time, comparing Ilbandornis woodburnei and three species of Dromornis to one another and to four species of extant basal galloanseres. We reveal that major endocranial reconfiguration was associated with cranial foreshortening in a temporal series along the Dromornis lineage. Five key differences are evident between the brain morphology of Ilbandornis and Dromornis, relating to the medial wulst, the ventral eminence of the caudoventral telencephalon, and morphology of the metencephalon (cerebellum + pons). Additionally, dromornithid brains display distinctive dorsal (rostral position of the wulst), and ventral morphology (form of the maxillomandibular [V2+V3], glossopharyngeal [IX], and vagus [X] cranial nerves), supporting hypotheses that dromornithids are more closely related to basal galliforms than anseriforms. Functional interpretations suggest that dromornithids were specialised herbivores that likely possessed well-developed stereoscopic depth perception, were diurnal and targeted a soft browse trophic niche. © 2021 by the authors.

They possessed a wide variety of body shapes and were adapted to a broad range of food sources. Two other neopterygian clades possessing similar ecological adaptations in both body morphology (†Dapediiformes) and dentition (Ginglymodi) also occurred in Mesozoic seas. Although these groups occupied the same marine ecosystems, the role that competitive exclusion and niche partitioning played in their ability to survive alongside each other remains unknown. Using geometric morphometrics on both the lower jaw (as constraint for feeding adaptation) and body shape (as constraint for habitat adaptation), we show that while dapediiforms and ginglymodians occupy similar lower jaw morphospace, pycnodontiforms are completely separate. Separation also occurs between the clades in body shape so that competition reduction between pycnodontiforms and the other two clades would have resulted in niche partitioning. Competition within pycnodontiforms seemingly was reduced further by evolving different feeding strategies as shown by disparate jaw shapes that also indicate high levels of plasticity. Acanthomorpha was a teleostean clade that evolved later in the Mesozoic and which has been regarded as implicated in driving the pycnodontiforms to extinction. Although they share similar body shapes, no coeval acanthomorphs had similar jaw shapes or dentitions for dealing with hard prey like pycnodontiforms do and so their success being a factor in pycnodontiform extinction is unlikely. Sea surface temperature and eustatic variations also had no impact on pycnodontiform diversity patterns according to our results. Conversely, the occurrence and number of available reefs and hardgrounds as habitats through time seems to be the main factor in pycnodontiform success. Decline in such habitats during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene might have had deleterious consequences for pycnodontiform diversity.

SAR pixel offsets (SPO) provided a deep insight into the co-seismic surface deformation of the entire source zone. Based on iterations of a total of 451 models, our analysis of sentinel-1A data from ascending and descending tracks revealed surface deformation occurred in an area of 40 × 30 km with a maximum co-seismic uplift of 10 cm. We estimated geodetic moment of 1.9 × 1020 Nm corresponding to the magnitude (Mw 6.0) of the Mashhad mainshock for which the rupture has a planner geometry with uniform slip dislocation in an elastic half-space with slip of 0.35 ± 0.1 m; strike of N313°E having dip of 48° of the thrust fault associated with oblique motion. The rupture length of 45 ± 3 km along-strike and 30 ± 3 km down dip has been estimated. The best-fit fault model geometry derived from SDM suggests that rupture occurred in the vicinity of the Kashafrud thrust fault, located west to the main Kopeh-Dagh Fault with its strike of 315°E. It is observed that a maximum slip of 0.35 m occurred at a depth of 8 km that extended to 10 km in the crust, which is found to be in unison to the Coulomb stress model that showed low-stressed zone is associated with the majority of events of lower magnitude (M ≤ 4.5) in NE–SW to the mainshock, whilst the EW zone to the mainshock found relatively highly stressed as a probable source for generating relatively higher magnitude earthquakes (M &gt; 4.5) in the future.

Associated with the relatively cold and dry environments of GS.5.2 and 5.1, this phase of the Gravettian is characterized by two lithic typo-technical entities (faciès in French): the Noaillian (defined by the presence of Noailles burins) and the Rayssian (identified by the Raysse method of bladelet production). The two faciès have partially overlapping geographic distributions, with the Rayssian having a more northern and restricted geographic extension than the Noaillian. Their chronological relationship, however, is still unclear, and interpretations of their dual presence at many sites within the region of overlap are not yet consensual. Nonetheless, the absence of the Raysse method south of the Garonne River suggests that this valley may have separated two different cultural trajectories for which the Rayssian represents an adaptation to environmental conditions different from those associated with Noaillian assemblages south of the Garonne River. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis quantitatively using ecological niche modeling (ENM) methods. First, we critically evaluate published data to construct inventories of Noaillian and Rayssian archaeological sites. Next, using ENM methods, we estimate the ecological niches associated with the Middle Gravettian north (Noaillian + Rayssian) and south (Pyrenees Noaillian) of the Garonne River, which are then quantitatively evaluated and compared. Results demonstrate that, despite a relatively large degree of similarity, the niches differ significantly from one another in both geographic and environmental dimensions and that the niche associated with the northern Middle Gravettian is broader than that of the Pyrenees Noaillian. We propose that this pattern reflects different technological, subsistence and mobility strategies linked to the development of the Raysse method in the North, which was likely more advantageous in its environmental contexts than technologies employed by contemporaneous populations in the Pyrenees. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Culture-environment relationships; Ecological niche modeling; France; Middle gravettian; Noaillian; Rayssian,Ecology; Environmental technology; Rivers; Archaeological site; Degree of similarity; Dry environment; Ecological niche; Ecological niche modeling; Environmental conditions; Environmental contexts; Mobility strategy; Geographical distribution; adaptive management; archaeological evidence; climate variation; fossil assemblage; hypothesis testing; paleobiogeography; subsistence; technological development; valley; France; Garonne River; Pyrenees,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098958534,,FALSE,?

In this formation, we recognize five facies (pebbly sandstone, intensely bioturbated sandstone, medium- to coarse-grained cross-stratified sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, and planar laminated siltstone), assigned to two facies associations, interpreted as the deposits of wave-dominated upper shoreface and lower shoreface settings. Ichnoassemblages, which contain 23 ichnospecies in 18 ichnogenera, are assigned to the Skolithos and Cruziana ichnofacies, as well as mixed types, and include representatives of cubichnia, repichnia, pascichnia, fodinichnia, domichnia, and agrichnia, indicating diverse trace-making behaviours. High burrow-density with monospecific occurrences of Skolithos indicate R-selected life strategies and burrow production over a short time period. The anomalous occurrence of Paleodictyon implies that the trace-making organisms of graphoglyptids could inhabit resource-rich shoreface environments as well as resource-limited deep sea niches. To better understand ichnological evolution across the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary, a database of Permian to Middle Triassic ichnoassemblages was also compiled for wave-dominated shoreface settings (WDSS) globally, and three ichno-ecological measures (ichnodiversity, ethological category, and ichnodisparity) were evaluated. Ichnodiversity shows a stepwise decline in ichnotaxa through the Permian, a pronounced increase in the Early Triassic, and a second phase of decline towards the Middle Triassic. Ethological data exhibit a different trend, with mean and median values dramatically dropping to a late Permian nadir, followed by a significant increase across the P-Tr boundary, culminating in an Early Triassic acme. The globally depauperate nature of late Permian ichnoassemblages may reflect sampling bias or decreased preservation potential resulting from abundant benthos and well-developed mixed layer in the seafloor. The presence of anomalously diverse Early Triassic ichnoassemblages may be due to the WDSS habitat providing a ‘habitable zone’ for trace-making organisms to survive when most marine environments were stressful in the aftermath of the P-Tr mass extinction. We emphasise that caution is needed in interpreting ichnodiversity variations across the P-Tr mass extinction event, as it may reflect shifting of trace-making behaviours of the same animals, or replacement of different animals with the same behaviours. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Ethological category; Gondwana interior sea; Ichnodisparity; Ichnodiversity; Permian; Permian-Triassic extinction; Wave-dominated siliciclastic shoreface,Animals; Ecological measures; Life strategies; Marine environment; Mass extinction events; Permian-Triassic boundary; Preservation potential; Sandstone formations; Western Australia; Sandstone; database; extinction; fossil assemblage; Permian-Triassic boundary; sampling; seafloor; siliciclastic deposit; trace fossil; Australia; Carnarvon Basin; Western Australia; Cruziana; Skolithos,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097708491,,FALSE,

In North America, the ice-free corridor was the only major pathway for northward migration by megafaunal species during the last deglaciation. However, the timing and interplay among the late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions, climate change, habitat structure, and the opening and reforestation of the ice-free corridor have been unclear. Location: North America. Time period: 15–10 ka. Major taxa studied: Woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). Methods: For central North America and the ice-free corridor between 15 and 10 ka, we used a series of models and continental-scale datasets to reconstruct habitat characteristics and assess habitat suitability. The models and datasets include biophysical and statistical niche models Niche Mapper and Maxent, downscaled climate simulations from CCSM3 SynTraCE, LPJ-GUESS simulations of net primary productivity (NPP) and woody cover, and woody cover based upon fossil pollen from Neotoma. Results: The ice-free corridor may have been of limited suitability for traversal by mammoths and other grazers due to persistently low productivity by herbaceous plants and quick reforestation after opening 14 ka. Simultaneously, rapid reforestation and decreased forage productivity may have led to declining habitat suitability in central North America. This was possibly amplified by a positive feedback loop driven by reduced herbivory pressures, as mammoth population decline led to the further loss of open habitat. Main conclusions: Declining habitat availability south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and limited habitat availability in the ice-free corridor were contributing factors in North American extinctions of woolly mammoths and other large grazers that likely operated synergistically with anthropogenic pressures. The role of habitat loss and attenuated corridor suitability for the woolly mammoth extinction reinforce the critical importance of protected habitat connectivity during changing climates, particularly for large vertebrates. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate adaptation; habitat loss; ice-free corridor; late Quaternary extinctions; LPJ-GUESS; Maxent; migration bottleneck; Niche Mapper; woolly mammoth,climate variation; data set; habitat loss; last deglaciation; Laurentide Ice Sheet; mammoth; net primary production; paleoclimate; survival; North America; Mammuthus primigenius; Neotoma; Vertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097606456,,TRUE,

Weathering during much of the Precambrian Eon was dominated by very high pC02 (10x to >20x present atmospheric level, PAL) leading to acidic chemical weathering, with additional and very poorly constrained weathering influences of primitive biota. The Great Oxidation Event at 2.0-2.2 Ga was marked by a major increase in p02, which was still very low compared to modern conditions. Towards the end of the Precambrian (Neoproterozoic) at least two major Snowball Earth glaciations occurred, punctuated by rapid warming, which intensified weathering processes, leading to releases of nutrients to oceans and the Cambrian Explosion and diversification of life. By the early Paleozoic the first nonvascular land plants evolved; these were small in stature, lacked deep root systems, were spore-reproducing, and were limited to wet soil environments. They were followed by the arrival of invertebrate terrestrial soil organisms. By the Middle to Late Devonian, trees with deep-penetrating root systems evolved that accelerated weathering and soil formation through the release of organic acids, which enhanced clay production. Coincident with afforestation, a significant drop in pC02 (at or below PAL) and concomitant rise in p02 (for a time exceeding PAL) culminated at the end of the Paleozoic Era with widespread Carboniferous coal swamps. Paleosols record the end-Permian mass extinction and the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction and complement the marine records of these events. The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a transient 200 kyr warming spike attributed to release of methane hydrates, is considered the closest ancient analog to modern climate change.

They were the result of an evolutionary radiation that produced a unique guild of birds – giant, and totally wingless species that evolved in the absence of non-volant mammals. Recent advances in dating and paleoclimatology, and compilations of data on distributions of the nine species of moa, along with information on the geographic, topographic, climatic and edaphic characteristics of sites from which moa remains have been recovered, enabled us to test whether their evolutionary radiation truly was ‘adaptive’, producing ecologically distinct species. Randomization, resampling analyses of moa distributions across North and South Islands revealed highly significant geographic and ecological segregation, with different species tending to occupy different islands, regions within islands, or elevations within regions. Quadratic Discriminant Analyses demonstrated niche segregation at even finer scales, including that based on vegetation‑defined habitats and on local climatic, topographic and edaphic conditions. Moa distributions also appear to have been dynamic over time, shifting in their upper elevational limits as climatic conditions changed and vegetative zones shifted upward during the Holocene Epoch. Our ongoing studies are building on the results presented here to explore the temporal dynamics of moa distributions, assess differential responses of moa species to natural and anthropogenic drivers, and determine how these forces may have combined to cause the extinction of moa just a few centuries ago. © the authors, CC-BY 4.0 license.",Adaptive radiation; Dinornithiformes; Evolution; Geographic range; Moa; New zealand; Niches; Paleoecology,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122231453,,TRUE,

We investigate the roles of environmental and species-intrinsic factors in driving the rapid radiation of Saussurea (Asteraceae) by deploying a number of palaeoenvironment-, diversity- and trait-dependent models, as well as ecological distribution data. We show that three main clades of Saussurea began to diversify in the Miocene almost simultaneously, with increasing diversification rates (DRs) negatively dependent on palaeotemperature but not dependent on species diversity. Our trait-dependent models detect some adaptive morphological innovations associated with DR shifts, while indicating additional unobserved traits are also likely driving diversification. Accounting for ecological niche data, we further reveal that accelerations in DRs are correlated with niche breadth and the size of species' range. Our results point out a macroevolutionary scenario where both adaptive morphological evolution and ecological opportunities provided by palaeoenvironmental fluctuations triggered an exceptionally radiating diversification.

Here, paleodistribution modelling is used to assess distribution shifts of 17 Polylepis species during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), mid-Holocene (MH), and the Anthropocene in the central Andes. Species distribution models (SDMs) were computed by combining presence records and current climatic conditions using Maxent and projected onto three climatic scenarios for the LGM (~22,000 yr BP), the MH (~6,000 yr BP), and the Anthropocene (1,970–2,000). Subsequently, current refugia hotspots were identified by intersecting suitable habitat over the LGM, MH, and anthropogenic conditions for all the studied species. SDMs for the LGM and MH showed a contraction of climate suitable habitat for most of the species in comparison to the Anthropocene. Four current refugia hotspots were identified: central Cordillera of Peru, Lake Titicaca basin, western Cordillera of Bolivia, and northern Chile. In general, SDMs were consistent with patterns proposed with pollen records, and partially with available phylogeographic studies.

In this work, we identify vascular plant species with long-distance disjunctions across SDTF patches of South America based on information available in online repositories and on species taxonomy and distribution, to explore species’ biogeographic patterns. Specifically, we combine distribution data from the Brazilian Flora 2020 Project (BFG) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to identify species with a peri-Amazonian distribution, and then use species distribution models to discuss possible scenarios of peri-Amazonian distributions under Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. We identified 81 candidate species for peri-Amazonian distributions in SDTFs, including shrubs, herbs, trees and lianas, and provided a summary of their main fruit dispersion syndrome based on the literature to identify prevalent dispersal patterns. The study species responded differently to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, with both contractions and expansions through time in different rates and did not show consistent larger distributions during past climate conditions. Our results show that a peri-Amazonian distribution is also present in growth-forms other than trees. Also, the prevalence of species with long-distance dispersal strategies such as wind or vertebrate-dispersed can suggest, although biased for Neotropical taxa, an alternative scenario of long-distance dispersal, possibly using stepping-stones of azonal vegetation. We argue that such an alternative scenario, especially for species disjunct with long-dispersal abilities, should be considered to test if SDTF disjunctions are relics of a past widespread distribution or not. © 2021.

Consequently, it is also difficult to evaluate the resilience of these ecosystems' plant and animal communities to that impact. Unfortunately, lake ecosystem response to natural cycles of lake-level and salinity fluctuation at multi-annual time scales is poorly understood, due to complex relationships between hydrological dynamics and the local availability or distribution of ecological niches. We present a 1650-yr-long paleoecological record from Lake Naivasha in Kenya (East Africa) which traces community assembly and turnover in two prominent groups of benthic invertebrates (chironomids and ostracods) in response to a climate-driven sequence of 10 major lake-level fluctuations. Over this time period, lake depth (inferred from sedimentology) fluctuated between ~3 and >35 m, and salinity (inferred from fossil diatom assemblages) varied between ~100 and ~23,500 µS/cm. Prior to ~780 yr ago, the unique community response to salinity was stronger than to lake depth. Around that time the lake transitioned to a more open hydrology, relatively stable freshwater conditions and greater prevalence of macrophyte-associated benthic habitat, so that community response to variations in lake depth (and surface area) became stronger. Notably, major community restructuring in the course of this transition was not synchronous between the two groups, because it depended on the proliferation of key freshwater species in each group. Our results imply that (1) climate-sensitive lake ecosystems are more likely controlled by salinity change if both its amplitude and frequency are large enough to induce ecological species sorting; (2) community response to such salinity changes may be predictable, and likely to show coherence across different groups of aquatic biota; and (3) the timing of major community restructuring strongly depends on the ecology of key species, and whether the species sorting is driven by salinity change itself or indirectly by the salinity-dependent availability of ecological niches. © 2021 The Authors.",Africa; chironomids; community assembly; faunal turnover; lake ecosystem dynamics; lake-level fluctuation; ostracods; Ramsar; resilience; salinity; wetland,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099834091,,FALSE,

However, dramatic Pleistocene climatic oscillations could also lead to species turnover but have widely been ignored. Here, we used ecological niche modelling (ENM) of 288 passerine species in the Himalayas to test the effect of climate change during the Last Interglacial Period (LIG), the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present day. The ENM analyses hindcasted species persistence through climate change from the LGM to the present day but likely showed a high degree of species turnover (e.g. 32.6–46.2%) from the LIG to the LGM. Further elevational dynamic reconstructions demonstrated that species might survive these two periods of climate change by upward and downward shifts, respectively. Statistical analyses of climatic variables showed increased climatic variability in the Himalayas during the LIG, which might have caused community turnover. The severe evolutionary consequence of the LIG climate in the Himalayas contrasts with the paradigm of the climatic optimum in Europe and North America and suggests potential geography-dependent effects of past climate change. More importantly, our results demonstrate that dramatic historical climate change might overwhelm the buffering effect of elevational heterogeneity, which should be considered when investigating the origin of tropical montane biodiversity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Community turnover; Ecological niche modelling; Himalayan birds; Historical climate change; Tropical buffering effect,Biodiversity; Climate models; Tropics; Climatic oscillations; Climatic variability; Climatic variables; Dynamic reconstruction; Ecological niche modelling; Last Glacial Maximum; Last interglacial; Species persistence; Climate change; biodiversity; buffering; community composition; hindcasting; Last Glacial Maximum; mountain environment; niche breadth; passerine; tropical environment; Europe; Himalayas; North America; Passeriformes,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099760296,,TRUE,

As it is an endangered species that makes up plant communities with great palaeoecological signifi-cance, the development of species distribution models is of major interest under different climatic scenarios, past, present and future, based on the fact that the climate could play a relevant role in the distribution of this species, as well as in the conformation of the communities in which it is integrated. Palaeoecological models were generated for the Maximum Interglacial, Last Maximum Glacial and Middle Holocene periods. The results obtained showed that the widest distribution of this species, and the maximum suitability of its habitat, occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum, when the temperatures of the peninsular southeast were not as contrasting as those of the rest of the European continent and were favored by higher rainfall. Under these conditions, large territories could act as shelters during the glacial period, a hypothesis reflected in the model’s results for this period, which exhibit a further expansion of M. europaea’s ecological niche. The future projection of models in around 2070, for four Representative Concentration Pathways according to the fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, showed that the most favorable areas for this species would be Campo de Dalías (southern portion of Almería province) as it presents the bioclimatic characteristics of greater adjustment to M. europaea’s ecological niche model. Currently, some of the largest specimens of the species survive in the agricultural landscapes in the southern Spain. These areas are almost totally destroyed and heavily altered by intensive agriculture greenhouses, also causing a severe fragmentation of the habitat, which implies a prospective extinction scenario in the near future. © 2020 by the authors.

However, for many species, this baseline information does not exist. With reliable presence data, spatial models that predict geographic ranges and identify environmental processes regulating distribution are a cost-effective and rapid method to achieve this. Yet these spatial models are lacking for many rare and threatened species, particularly in tropical regions. The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a Neotropical forest raptor of conservation concern with a continental distribution across lowland tropical forests in Central and South America. Currently, the harpy eagle faces threats from habitat loss and persecution and is categorized as Near-Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Within a point process modeling (PPM) framework, we use presence-only occurrences with climatic and topographical predictors to estimate current and past distributions and define environmental requirements using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The current PPM prediction had high calibration accuracy (Continuous Boyce Index = 0.838) and was robust to null expectations (pROC ratio = 1.407). Three predictors contributed 96% to the PPM prediction, with Climatic Moisture Index the most important (72.1%), followed by minimum temperature of the warmest month (15.6%) and Terrain Roughness Index (8.3%). Assessing distribution in environmental space confirmed the same predictors explaining distribution, along with precipitation in the wettest month. Our reclassified binary model estimated a current range size 11% smaller than the current IUCN range polygon. Paleoclimatic projections combined with the current model predicted stable climatic refugia in the central Amazon, Guyana, eastern Colombia, and Panama. We propose a data-driven geographic range to complement the current IUCN range estimate and that despite its continental distribution, this tropical forest raptor is highly specialized to specific environmental requirements. © 2020 The Authors.

Together, such datasets hold tremendous potential to understand species' space use at broad spatial scale, through the development of species distribution or habitat suitability models (SDMs) to predict environmental dependencies of species across space and time. However, tracking datasets can be heavily biased and an assessment of how such biases affect SDM predictions, and therefore, our interpretation of animal distributions is lacking. We generated simulated tracks based on predetermined environmental values for a random predator and a central place forager, and then sampled positions from those tracks based on a combination of five common biases in tracking datasets: (a) tagging location; (b) tracking device; (c) data gaps within tracks; (d) premature tag detachment (or failure) and (e) different processing methods. We then used 240 combinations of the resulting biased simulated datasets to develop binomial generalised linear (GLM) and additive (GAM) models to estimate habitat suitability in different environmental sets (cool deep, cool coastal, warm deep and warm coastal environments). Our results show that tagging location and length of tracks have the largest effects in decreasing model performance, but that these biases can be overcome by adding a small percentage of additional, relatively less biased tracks to the dataset. In comparison, the effects from all other biases were almost negligible, including for low resolution tracking datasets for which sufficient tracks are available. We also highlight the need for a cautionary approach when using processing methods that can introduce other biases (e.g. interpolated locations). Similar trends were obtained for the random predator and the central place forager, but with relatively lower model performance for the latter. We provide evidence that even non-GPS tracking datasets can be readily used to improve the knowledge of large-scale space use by species without the need for detailed processing and tracking reconstruction.

During periods of unfavourable climatic conditions, species retreat to refugia from where they may later expand. This paper focuses on the palaeoecology of red deer over the past 54 ka across Europe and the Urals, to reveal patterns of change in their range and explore the role of environmental conditions in determining their distribution. Location: Europe and western Asia to 63°E. Taxon: Red deer (Cervus elaphus). Methods: We collected 984 records of radiocarbon-dated red deer subfossils from the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene, including 93 original dates. For each deer sample we compiled climatic and biome type data for the corresponding time intervals. Results: During the last 54 ka changes in red deer range in Europe and the Urals were asynchronous and differed between western and eastern Europe and western Asia due to different environmental conditions in those regions. The range of suitable areas for deer during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was larger than previously thought and covered vast regions not only in southern but also in western and eastern Europe. Throughout the period investigated the majority of specimens inhabited forests in the temperate climatic zone. The contribution of forests in deer localities significantly decreased during the last 4 ka, due to deforestation of Europe caused by humans. Mean January temperature was the main limiting factor for species distribution. Over 90% of the samples were found in areas where mean January temperature was above −10°C. Main conclusions: Red deer response to climatic oscillations are in agreement with the Expansion-Contraction model but in contradiction to the statement of only the southernmost LGM refugia of the species.

Pooideae responses to climate changes at different time scales, and different ecological zones are thus important in understanding Poaceae evolutionary processes and their relationship with climate change. In the study described in this article, we reconstructed Pooideae variability during the early Holocene, as inferred by a phytolith sequence from the Lower Yangtze in subtropical China. The phytolith assemblage was marked by three increases in Pooideae phytoliths, dated to ca 8.4–8.0, 7.8–7.6, and 7.4–7.2 ka BP (before present, 1950 AD), with each representing pronounced increases in Pooideae extent and distribution. All these increases were within age ranges that agreed well with the timing of weak Asian Monsoon events, at 8.2, 7.7, and 7.3 ka BP. The first Pooideae flourishing period in subtropical China was the most significant, lasting for approximately four centuries and being characterized by a double peak, which equated with an event at 8.2 ka. This suggested that cold and/or dry conditions—which occurred over a period of several hundred years and were linked to weakening of the Asian monsoon—probably caused Pooideae to flourish in the Lower Yangtze region. Comparison of two diagnostic trapezoid phytolith types—namely wavy and wavy narrow—which showed different changes between ca 8.4 and 8.0 ka BP, suggested that they responded differently to the climate change represented by the 8.2 ka event. Our phytolith records have provided not only new data clarifying the detailed Pooideae response to the 8.2 ka event but also a reliable index for past cold climates in subtropical China.

The timing of radiations in some groups is held to be linked to these geoclimatic trends. Using the Scarabaeinae dung beetle genus, Sisyphus, as a model system, we investigate how geological uplift and climatic changes in the late Cenozoic affected its diversification patterns in southern Africa. Location: Southern Africa. Taxon: The dung beetle genus, Sisyphus Latreille, 1807 (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae). Methods: A dated molecular phylogeny of southern African Sisyphus was compared with a factor analysis of species distribution data that statistically defined groups of species according to current climatic distribution. We used these climatic clusters to estimate ancestral ranges using the “BioGeoBEARS” R package. A lineage through time plot was calculated using the R package ‘APE’. We used Bayesian diversification models (compound Poisson process on mass extinction times) to test hypotheses on how late Cenozoic uplift and climatic changes affected speciation and extinction of Sisyphus. Furthermore, we implemented ecological niche modelling in MaxEnt to predict the habitat suitability of species under present climatic conditions. Results: Four species groups defined from factor analysis of current climatic distribution data are primarily restricted to the moist summer rainfall region in the northeast. Species diversification occurred from the mid-Miocene until the Pleistocene, during which the central southern African plateau was uplifted in tandem with the advent of winter rainfall and arid climatic zones to the southwest. The ancestor of Sisyphus was centred in eastern low to mid-altitude areas. Speciation rates were higher in the Miocene to Pliocene, followed by a dramatic drop during the transition to the Pleistocene. Main conclusions: The taxonomic and eco-climatic diversification of sisyphines is coincident with geological uplift and changes in climate in east-central southern Africa.

In this study, we utilized ENM to directly and independently reconstruct the Mid-Holocene distribution of the desert bighorn sheep, using rock art as an alternative source of past distributional information, in order to gain a better understanding of changes in the distribution of this species over the last 6,000 years. Location: North American deserts. Taxon: Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni). Methods: We used 225 current locality records, eight bioclimatic variables from WorldClim and 57 past locality records based on rock art, in combination with CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM scenarios for the Mid-Holocene, to reconstruct via ENM the present and past ecological niches and geographic distribution of the species. For modelling ecological niches, we used Maxent, and the models were evaluated using a partial ROC test. We used a niche similarity test to compare present and past reconstructions, performing niche transfers to measure their inter-predictability, supported by a previous Mobility Oriented Parity test of climate analogy. Results: The performances of the potential distribution models for the Mid-Holocene and present were statistically significant and describe a recent increase in the species’ distributional areas, suggesting that past conditions were characterized by higher temperatures and lower precipitation, as was corroborated by the niche transfers. The niche similarity test showed no differences between the past and present niches. Main conclusions: The models generated from rock art allowed a consistent reconstruction of the ecological niches and present and past distributions of the species. We therefore consider rock art to be a valuable, but hitherto largely ignored, source of information for this species.

Niche analysis approaches such as the multilevel perspective model (MLP) explain how such a process grows from innovation within a very restricted field to its generalized application on a global scale. Shipping is a sector particularly challenged by the transition process away from heavy fuel oil towards more environment-friendly alternatives such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or even non-fossil alternatives. Within this industry, Norway stands as an early adopter and leader of the emerging transition. Drawing from a wide discussion of the treatment of scale in transition literature and from this national case study, we propose that the transition process can emerge not only from a local niche perspective, as widely documented in the literature, but can also be driven by changes at a much larger scale and initiated by new international regulations. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we tackle the geobiology of this Lagerstätte by the combined analysis of paleontological features, sedimentary facies, and lipid biomarkers. The Khatyspyt Formation was deposited in carbonate ramp environments. Organic matter (0.12–2.22 wt.% TOC) displays characteristic Ediacaran biomarker features (e.g., eukaryotic steranes dominated by the C29 stigmastane). Some samples contain a putative 2-methylgammacerane that was likely sourced by ciliates and/or bacteria. 24-isopropylcholestane and 26-methylstigmastane are consistently scarce (≤0.4% and ≤0.2% of ∑C27-30 regular steranes, respectively). Thus, Avalon-type organisms occupied different niches than organisms capable of directly synthesizing C30 sterane precursors among their major lipids. Relative abundances of eukaryotic steranes and bacterial hopanes (sterane/hopane ratios = 0.07–0.30) demonstrate oligotrophic and bacterially dominated marine environments, similar to findings from other successions with Ediacara-type fossils. Ediacara-type fossils occur in facies characterized by microbial mats and biomarkers indicative for a stratified marine environment with normal–moderate salinities (moderate–high gammacerane index of 2.3–5.7; low C35 homohopane index of 0.1–0.2). Mega-algae, in contrast, are abundant in facies that almost entirely consist of allochthonous event layers. Biomarkers in these samples indicate a non-stratified marine environment and normal salinities (low gammacerane index of 0.6–0.8; low C35 homohopane index of 0.1). Vertical burrowers occur in similar facies but with biomarker evidence for stratification in the water column or around the seafloor (high gammacerane index of 5.6). Thus, the distribution of macro-organisms and burrowers was controlled by various, dynamically changing environmental factors. It appears likely that dynamic settings like the Khatyspyt Lagerstätte provided metabolic challenges for sustenance and growth which primed eukaryotic organisms to cope with changing environmental habitats, allowing for a later diversification and expansion of complex macroscopic life in the marine realm. © 2020 The Authors.

The lability of skeletal composition among octocorals suggests a greater ability to adapt to changes in ocean chemistry compared with the homogeneity of the aragonitic skeleton of scleractinian corals. Pulses of diversification in anthozoans follow mass extinctions and reef crises, with sea anemones and proteinaceous corals filling empty niches as tropical reef builders went extinct. Changing environmental conditions will likely diminish aragonitic reef-building scleractinians, but the evolutionary history of the Anthozoa suggests other groups will persist and diversify in their wake. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",,sea water; animal; Anthozoa; pH; sea; skeleton; Animals; Anthozoa; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Skeleton,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089962727,,FALSE,

Analysis of fish remains investigates fluctuations in the fish communities that are markers of changes in the paleoenvironment. The 8112 taxonomically identified remains document diagnostic taxa that are drought-tolerant (armoured catfishes, swamp-eels and tiger fishes) and from swampy environments, indicating probable occupation during low-waters periods. The results from Monte Castelo contrasts with the use of shell mounds as refuges from high-water season floods, a dominant hypothesis. A considerable shift in the nature of the fish spectrum occurred around 4000 BP with increased diversity; the number of taxa jumps from 18 to 48. The Middle Holocene occupations, from 6000 to 4000 BP, reflect long-term stability in drought-tolerant taxa collaborating with paleoecological evidence of dryer conditions. The post 4000 BP introduction of small-sized cichlids and characins suggests an initial exploitation of flooded forests. Archeological fish remains corroborate paleoenvironmental records of increased precipitation between the Middle and Late-Holocene. The probable replacement of some savanna areas by forest vegetation, and the accompanying alteration of aquatic landscapes, is documented through the presence/absence of certain taxa in Monte Castelo’s occupations. This suggests new economic strategies and the exploitation of new ecological niches, as the fish remains correspond to approximately 80% of the vertebrate fauna throughout the archeological sequence. © The Author(s) 2020.",Amazon; paleoenvironment; shell mound; zooarchaeology,archaeology; climate variation; fauna; flood; Holocene; hypothesis testing; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; shell; Amazonia; Characidae; Cichlidae; Pisces; Siluriformes; Synbranchidae; Vertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088250226,,FALSE,?

The geographic ranges of the different species of Tympanoctomys have been described in general terms but have not been associated with spatial and climate data. Within species, populations are patchily distributed and genetically distinct. We investigated the predicted distribution of Tympanoctomys and the influence of climate fluctuations on their geographic range in historical, current, and future, scenarios. Our objectives were to characterize the environmental niche of the genus, propose a paleoclimatic context for the oldest fossils, characterize the environmental niches for T. barrerae and T. kirchnerorum, and forecast potential future distributions for these taxa. Ecological niche models were constructed using occurrence records from 1941 to the present wherein we identified several precipitation and temperature variables as important predictors of the geographic distributions of the genus, and the species T. barrerae and T. kirchnerorum. Based on our models' results, we hypothesize that the distribution of Tympanoctomys has contracted from historical to modern times. At the species level, T. kirchnerorum likely experienced the most dramatic change, suffering a large contraction of its historical distribution resulting in its limited present distribution. Given these findings, projected future climate fluctuations and global warming are expected to affect the distributions and persistence of these species. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

They are frequently used as paleo-indicators for megathermal climates, and therefore, it is logical to predict that palms will benefit from predicted warmer temperatures under anthropogenic climate change. We created species distribution models to explore the projected ranges of five widespread southeastern North American palm species (Rhapidophyllum hystrix, Sabal etonia, Sabal minor, Sabal palmetto, and Serenoa repens) under four climate change scenarios through 2070. We project that the amount of habitat with >50% suitability for S. etonia will decline by a median of 50% by 2070, while the amount of habitat with >50% suitability S. minor will decline by a median of 97%. In contrast, the amount of suitable habitat for Rhapidophyllum hystrix will remain stable, while the amount of suitable habitat for Serenoa repens will slightly increase. The projected distribution for S. palmetto will increase substantially, by a median of approximately 21% across all scenarios. The centroid of the range of each species will shift generally north at a median rate of 23.5 km/decade. These five palm species have limited dispersal ability and require a relatively long time to mature and set fruit. Consequently, it is likely that the change in the distribution of these palms will lag behind the projected changes in climate. However, Arecaceae can modify physiological responses to heat and drought, which may permit these palms to persist as local conditions become increasingly inappropriate. Nonetheless, this plasticity is unlikely to indefinitely prevent local extinctions. © 2020 The Authors.

(2) The results of SDM show that the impact of urban sprawl on the CO2 emissions can be regarded as a N-shaped curve. Both excessively rapid expansion of urban space and excessively rapid growth of urban population can intensify the CO2 emissions. (3) The tests of regional heterogeneity show that in underdeveloped provinces, the effect of urban sprawl on CO2 emissions could also be a N-shaped curve, but it is an inversed U-shaped for the developed provinces. Thus, it can diminish the emissions of CO2 in developed provinces, through strengthening environmental regulations and restraining the excessively rapid growth of the urban population. However, the underdeveloped provinces should actively promote economic development and create more jobs to avoid the loss of labors.

Diatom communities have traditionally been assumed to be a collection of r-selected, ecologically redundant generalist taxa with distributions constrained largely by dispersal limitation. Here, we challenge this notion by presenting a novel model that uses distributional data to estimate ecological specialization for groups of diatom taxa. We further develop this model to evaluate relationships among ecological specialization, taxonomic richness, and species’ abundance using field data collected from ancient Lake Matano and the broader Malili Lakes system (Sulawesi, Indonesia), as well as Mazinaw Lake (Ontario, Canada). We demonstrated that diatom niche breadth is highly variable both at the assemblage scale and among genera within assemblages. Ecologically-specialized genera exhibited higher taxonomic richness than their generalist counterparts, suggesting that ecological specialization serves to support the sympatric coexistence of multiple species by limiting competitive interactions among congeneric taxa. This assertion is further supported by species’ abundance patterns, which suggested that resources are evenly partitioned among taxa within specialist genera, while less-specialized genera are composed of taxa with either exceptionally high or exceptionally low abundances reflective of their relative success in competitive interactions with one another. Our findings indicate that the often-overlooked complement of rare taxa within diatom assemblages are in fact the entities that respond most sensitively to environmental conditions and are worthy of far greater consideration in environmental assessment and paleolimnological studies. © 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research",Ancient lakes; Community ecology; Diatoms; Lake Matano; Malili Lakes; Niche,Lakes; Biological community; Community structures; Competitive interactions; Diatom assemblage; Diatom communities; Environmental assessment; Environmental conditions; Taxonomic richness; Ecology; abundance; benthic environment; coexistence; community composition; community structure; diatom; dispersal; environmental assessment; environmental conditions; fossil assemblage; lacustrine environment; niche breadth; specialization; species richness; taxonomy; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Lake Matano; Lake Ontario; Malili Lakes; Malili Lakes; South Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Bacillariophyta,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087949296,,FALSE,

However, the extent to which these geographical contexts influence evolutionary trajectories remains poorly understood, in part because few studies have focused on species-rich clades colonizing continents and archipelagos over comparable timeframes. Focusing on a diverse songbird clade radiating on the African continent and adjacent islands, we tested whether morphological evolution is best explained by adaptive or non-adaptive processes, and whether mainland and island lineages evolved to occupy different regions or volumes of morphological space (morphospace). Location: Palaeotropics, with a particular focus on the Afrotropical region. Taxon: White-eyes, Zosterops (Aves: Zosteropidae). Methods: We generated principal component axes from novel trait data for 120 species and combined this information with a comprehensive dated phylogeny. We then analysed the dynamics of trait and lineage diversification using comparative evolutionary methods. Results: An early burst and slowdown pattern of lineage accumulation is not mirrored by phenotypic evolution, which instead shows an apparent convergence on particular phenotypes. However, the overall signature of phenotypic convergence is strongly driven by mainland taxa, in which phenotypes appear to be highly constrained within elevational zones, while speciation events are often associated with phenotypic divergence from one body plan to the other after colonization of highland from lowland habitats, or vice versa. By contrast, island lineages have repeatedly explored novel areas of morphospace with patterns of phenotypic divergence generally not distinguishable from a random-walk model. Main conclusions: Diversification of Zosterops highlights contrasting evolutionary trends and dynamics for continental versus island species. We suggest the different trajectory of evolution in insular lineages arises from reduced species competition leading to an increase in ecological opportunity, thereby providing a release to phenotypic constraints experienced by continental taxa. © 2020 The Authors.

Specifically, we hypothesized that our integrated approach is sensitive enough to detect geographical shifts in suitable habitat between lineages and through evolutionary time. Location: North America. Taxon: Sceloporus lizards. Methods: We used extant and fossil occurrence data, general circulation models of palaeoclimate, climate envelope modelling and phylogenetic comparative methods to reconstruct past suitable climates for Sceloporus lizards over the last 20 million years, and then visualized the geographical locations of individual lineages using multivariate environmental similarity surfaces (MESS) maps. Results: We were able to reconstruct ancestral suitable climate for Sceloporus lineages with sufficient resolution to identify shifts in geographical location between lineages. We found that large shifts in climate regimes drove the expansion and contraction of suitable habitat through time. We found a positive association between tectonic events, like mountain uplift, and lineage diversification in the Sceloporus clade. Mountain uplift also facilitated the emergence of open grassland habitat, which excluded many Sceloporus species. Main conclusions: Our approach was sensitive enough to detect differences in geographical location of suitable habitat across lineages and through evolutionary time. Doing so is a critical first step to tracking the evolutionary ecology of individual taxa over long periods of evolutionary time, and to inferring which species co-existed in which locations.

This study investigates the manner in which the realised hominin climate niche has expanded, contracted, or stayed stationary across four time periods (Last Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum, Mid-Holocene, and 1950–2000) in Western Eurasia. Using spatially gridded general circulation model data and site locations this study examines climate variables from archaeological sites and current Western Eurasian cities to describe both the regional Western Eurasian fundamental and realised climate niches. Changes between the three prehistoric periods and modern-day time period are analysed by calculating each realised niche breadth, overlap, position, and variance. Results indicate that as global temperatures cooled from the Last Interglacial to Last Glacial Maximum, populations expanded their climate niche breadth beyond that of earlier Neanderthal groups, shifting toward regions with less seasonal variation. Conversely, Mid-Holocene humans, who saw the proliferation of both agriculture and population, contracted their realised climate niche space. The contraction and expansion of realised climate niche space illustrates how hominins have evolved the capacity to shift their niche through changes to their subsistence strategy and adaptations to overall climatic conditions. © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2019.",fundamental and realised niches; Last Glacial Maximum; Last Interglacial; Paleoclimates; population shifts; Western Eurasia,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070968073,,TRUE,?

The measured stable isotope compositions in bone tissue are δ13C, δ15N and δ18O. All the analyzed samples were recovered from different archaeological sites from the late Holocene. According to the results, the guanaco was strictly confined to the Pampa plain environment, developing a broad niche based on C3 plants and a variable contribution of C4 grasses within a grazing trend. The pampas deer preferentially used the Pampa plain, but also the prairies on the borders of the wetland, showing eurioic characteristics and a narrower niche based on C3 plants. In turn, the marsh deer was strictly confined to wetland environments, developing a C3 diet–base, within a narrow isotopic niche and stenoic characteristics. The three mammals showed a wide range of intraspecific variability, which was a key factor in their adaptability to spatial and temporal changes in the vegetation coverage. In fact, the temporal trends of their isotopic values were concurrent with the major climatic variations of the Holocene. Differences in the correlations between the values of both carbon sources in both deer species compared with the guanaco suggest a distinct chemical composition of their diet and/or differences in the allocation of nutrients. The isotopic values of nitrogen and spacing of the carbon sources in guanaco (pseudoruminant) and both deer species (ruminants) show no significant differences between them, thus establishing the values for local large herbivores. Significant correlations between δ13C and δ15N were found in the guanaco and marsh deer. The regional and extra–regional variability in the guanaco's δ13Ccollagen and δ15N probably reflect the clinal variations in the vegetation coverage and the amount of rainfall. The collagen isotope values in the guanaco throughout the entire Holocene show that the humid Pampa would have shifted between being a more recurrent mesic and temperate plain with minor phases of dry–mesic conditions like during the Little Ice Age, and a humid and warm one at the peaks of the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the Medieval Climatic Anomaly. The guanaco and the pampas deer adapted to all the climatic changes that happened on the humid Pampa until the biological invasions of large European mammals changed the herbivores’ guild composition of this vast plain, pushing them into peripheral habitats due to competition. The within–species variability in isotopic signals through time and space make it necessary to carry out adequate sampling before reconstructing the diets of local past populations. © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2019.",Guanaco; Holocene climatic variations; isotopic niche; marsh deer; Pampa region; Pampas deer; δ13C; δ15N; δ18O,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063256569,,TRUE,

However, district energy systems (DESs) and their transitions are overlooked by US communities in their sustainable agendas. This research applied the multi-level perspective and co-evolutionary framework to investigate DESs' transition context and niche level practices from DES operators'/designers' perspectives. Document review approach was adopted to delineate DESs' transition context. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate DES operators'/designers' visions and how they interact with factors related to ecosystems, technology, institutions, and users for near-term transitions. This research found that DESs in the US served about 10% and 12% of fully air-conditioned floor space for heating and cooling, respectively. About 93% of services provided by DESs in the US were powered by fossil fuels, and 79% of DESs distributed steam. Current federal and state policies play limited role in promoting DESs, while local policies can only encourage niche-level innovations. Results from interviews demonstrated that DES operators/designers foresaw that DESs would move toward the advanced ones. DES operators/designers were motivated by the users’ demand and emerging local policy preferences to take action. Thus, DES operators/designers emphasized the importance of working closely with users and policymakers, engaging potential customers, and tapping into technical expertise during the process of transition. These results indicate that DES operators/designers took on many responsibilities with limited policy and market support. With low pressure to select DESs as a key sustainability tool at the regime level, the sustainable transition of DESs in the U.S. may only remain at the niche level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Co-evolutionary framework; District energy systems; Energy transitions; Socio-technical systems,Air conditioning; Fossil fuels; Sustainable development; Co-evolutionary; District energy systems; Document review; Heating and cooling; Local policies; Potential customers; Semi structured interviews; Technical expertise; Cooling systems,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085582062,,FALSE,

Using Maxent 3.4.1 software, this study has modeled the climatic niche of Daurian pika based on 273 points of its contemporary habitat and attempted to determine the pattern of changes in the spatial location of this niche under extreme scenarios of climate development in 2070. It is shown that the best models in terms of statistical validation unsatisfactorily predict the range of the species niche in areas that were not used during the construction of the model and can serve as a climate surrogate at other time periods. A model for the future projection was selected so that it could provide the statistically best projections of the niche range in other areas. The largest contribution to the model construction was made by two variables: annual mean temperature and coefficient of precipitation variation. The constructed model was validated by the direct check of its projections in two ways. (1) A check for the presence of pika in three previously unexplored localities, where the climatic conditions are suitable for the habitation of Daurian pika according to the model, recorded the species only in one locality. It was then found that other abiotic factors in the other two localities proved to be inconsistent with the requirements of the species. (2) A comparison of the projections of the range to the time periods of 140 000–120 000, 21 000, and 6000 years ago with the fossils of the species in the respective periods shows that all currently known localities are within the ranges projected by the model. The expected climate changes do not lead to critical changes in the spread of living conditions for Ochotona dauurica; however, they may lead to noticeable changes in their area pattern, which is particularly pronounced under the RCP 8.5 development scenario (which projects the highest deviation from the existing distribution, a lower suitability of their contemporary habitats, and an increase in their fragmentation). © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",climatic niche; future and past projections; Maxent; Ochotona dauurica; validation,assessment method; climate change; climate conditions; habitat type; lagomorph; precipitation (climatology); type locality; vulnerability; Ochotona dauurica; Ochotonidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093856005,,TRUE,

Due to striking superficial similarities in the cranial skeleton, the same or similar skull and jaw functions have been inferred for sabre-toothed species and interpreted as an adaptation to subdue large-bodied prey. However, although some sabre-tooth lineages have been classified into different ecomorphs (dirk-tooths and scimitar-tooths) the functional diversity within and between groups and the evolutionary paths leading to these specializations are unknown. Here, we use a suite of biomechanical simulations to analyse key functional parameters (mandibular gape angle, bending strength, bite force) to compare the functional performance of different groups and to quantify evolutionary rates across sabre-tooth vertebrates. Our results demonstrate a remarkably high functional diversity between sabre-tooth lineages and that different cranial function and prey killing strategies evolved within clades. Moreover, different biomechanical adaptations in coexisting sabre-tooth species further suggest that this functional diversity was at least partially driven by niche partitioning. © 2020 The Author(s).",computational analysis; convergent evolution; ecology; functional morphology; Smilodon,adaptation; canid; carnivore; convergent evolution; functional morphology; functional role; tooth; Smilodon; Vertebrata; anatomy and histology; animal; biomechanics; Carnivora; evolution; fossil; mandible; mastication; skull; tooth; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bite Force; Carnivora; Fossils; Mandible; Skull; Tooth,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092539974,,FALSE,

The consequences of the evolution of the durophagous predators in the Mesozoic Era are well documented among many invertebrates such as mollusks and brachiopods. However, they are less characterized among the echinoderms. In order to assess the consequence of increased predation on the echinoderms and to find the causality between their diversity/dispersion and the sea level variations, the echinoderm occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database was spatiotemporally analyzed. The results indicated that life habit, diet, and locomotion of the echinoderm communities have undergone a major shift. Indeed, a steady trend of increasing the mobile and infaunal taxa, which is a well-known predator-resistant life mode, was observed. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between carnivores and both of mobile and infaunal taxa (R = 0.70 and 0.56 respectively, p < 0.001), which indicates that mobility and infaunalization provide the opportunity to avoid predation. Moreover, there was a temporal shift in the latitudinal diversity gradient where the diversity peak occurs mainly between 10 and 40 N. Furthermore, there is a general concordance between the echinoderm diversity and the Mesozoic sea level curve. Cluster analyses and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) indicated that with increasing sea level, the fauna which was distinct among the different geographic provinces in the Triassic became more similar during the Cretaceous. The latter suggests that sea level is a major factor controlling the biogeographic pattern of the benthic invertebrates. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Biodiversity; Echinoderms; Mesozoic; Niche partitioning; Paleobiology database; Sea level rise,echinoderm; environmental factor; fossil record; invertebrate; Mesozoic; niche partitioning; predation; sea level change; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; Triassic; Brachiopoda; Echinodermata; Invertebrata; Mollusca,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089992254,,TRUE,?

However, paleoenvironmental data sources are often scarce. The integration of ecological niche modeling and paleoecological data can fill in this knowledge gap. In order to elucidate the potential impacts of past and future climate change on the distribution of multiple vegetation types, we used 433 occurrence points of 100 species to build distribution models of five vegetation types occurring in southern Brazil, based on past, current, and future scenarios. Past models indicated the existence of a steppe domain during the Last Glacial Maximum, with forest expansion during the Mid-Holocene, which is consistent with paleoenvironmental data. The current distribution model identified a large area that was climatically suitable for ecotones in an important protection area threatened by agribusiness. The optimistic projections for 2070 predicted an expansion of mixed ombrophilous and seasonal semi-deciduous forests to a higher altitude and latitude, respectively. The pessimistic projections predicted a catastrophic scenario, with the extinction of the steppe and the savanna and a major increase of areas unsuitable for all vegetation types. The ombrophilous dense forest remained stable in all time scenarios, even in the pessimistic future projection.

Here, we investigated the divergence and demographic history of Lindera glauca, a dioecious tree generally considered to be obligate sexual in China while comprising only females (apomicts) in Japan. Location: East Asia (China and Japan). Taxon: Lindera glauca (Lauraceae). Methods: Samples from 42 populations were genotyped using chloroplast DNA and nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci to assess genetic diversity and structure. The nSSR genotypes were also used to detect the mode of reproduction in Chinese and Japanese populations, respectively. Approximate Bayesian Computation on nSSRs and palaeoclimatic niche models provided further insights into the evolutionary and population demographic history. Results: Chinese L. glauca was found to harbour both sexual and asexual genotypes. Chinese and Japanese L. glauca underwent likely severe bottlenecks during a mid-Pleistocene glacial period, possibly marking the split time of the island lineage from its mainland ancestor. In contrast to Chinese L. glauca, the Japanese lineage experienced a massive range contraction during the Last Glacial Maximum and postglacial expansions. Main Conclusions: While reproductive assurance plays an important role in the selection of apomixis in Chinese L. glauca, the lack of male plants in Japan likely reflects population demographic history driven by (Late) Quaternary climate change.

Our hypothesis is that speciation in this group has been largely allopatric at regional scale, but involved morphological divergence at local scale through sympatric character displacement. Location: Australia, New Guinea and surrounding islands. Taxon: Dasyurid (Dasyuridae) marsupials, 67 species. Methods: Geographical range overlap was quantified using polygons representing the outer limits of species distributions. Local-scale range overlap was quantified as the degree of co-occurrence of two taxa across a set of ecological survey plots representing 83 sampled communities. Phylogenies were generated using a novel DNA dataset, with divergence times estimated via total-evidence dating incorporating fossils. Morphological divergence was determined using body mass and lower molar row length as proxy traits for reconstructing niche exploitation. Results: Sister species pairs were found to be sympatric in 52% (11/21) of cases. Range overlap tended to increase with node age, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian speciation is routinely allopatric. We detected no evidence of character displacement with increasing range overlap between sister species pairs. However, a negative relationship was observed between morphological divergence in body mass and range overlap across all sampled taxa, suggesting that selection in sympatry is convergent, while divergent selection occurs in allopatry. Local-scale co-occurrences revealed no trace of species aversion, indicating that competition has not impacted on the spatial distribution of dasyurids. Main conclusions: Despite moderate levels of sympatry through time, our results evince low rates of spatial co-occurrence between dasyurid species. Although this may be indicative competitive exclusion, the lack of character displacement suggests that biotic interactions have likely not acted as a dominant driver of phenotypic evolution in this radiation. We alternatively posit that abiotic factors including aridity and geographical connectivity have more feasibly propagated character convergence, and led to both niche conservatism and speciation in this ubiquitous australidelphian clade. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",age-range correlation; allopatric speciation; Australia; community phylogenetics; Dasyuridae; sister species,aridity; body mass; character displacement; divergence; marsupial; morphology; natural selection; spatial distribution; speciation (biology); species occurrence; Australia; New Guinea; Dasyuridae; Mammalia; Metatheria,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083344643,,FALSE,?

Here we constructed fossil food webs to identify changes in Late Ordovician (Katian) shallow-marine paleocommunity structure and functioning before and after the Richmondian invasion, a well-documented ancient invasion. Food webs were compared using descriptive metrics and cascading extinction on graphs models. Richness at intermediate trophic levels was underrepresented when using only data from the Paleobiology Database relative to museum collections, resulting in a spurious decrease in modeled paleocommunity stability. Therefore, museum collections and field sampling may provide more reliable sources of data for the reconstruction of trophic organization in comparison to online data repositories. The invasion resulted in several changes in ecosystem dynamics. Despite topological similarities between pre- and postinvasion food webs, species loss occurred corresponding to a minor decrease in functional groups. Invaders occupied all of the preinvasion functional guilds, with the exception of four incumbent guilds that were lost and one new guild, corroborating the notion that invaders replace incumbents and fill preexisting niche space. Overall, models exhibited strong resistance to secondary extinction, although the postinvasion community had a lower threshold of collapse and more variable response to perturbation. We interpret these changes in dynamics as a decrease in stability, despite similarities in overall structure. Changes in food web structure and functioning resulting from the invasion suggest that conservation efforts may need to focus on preserving functional diversity if more diverse ecosystems are not inherently more stable.

Recent studies on beak morphologies and morphogenesis in Darwin's finches have greatly improved our understanding of how avian beaks adapt to various ecological niches, but the question of how birds lost their teeth during the course of evolution has long been debated. Evolutionary developmental experiments performed on extant bird embryos bridge the gap between paleontological and neontological evidence, suggesting that the avian beak could have originated through heterochronic truncation of odontogenesis over evolutionary time. Here, we systematically review independently evolved regional and complete edentulism present in nonavialan and avialan theropod dinosaurs, and suggest that the tooth-reduction processes of different jaw bones are likely to be independently controlled. Through reviewing the recent advances of molecular regulations involved in tooth and avian beak morphogenic processes, we suggest that several molecules regulating the development of the avian beak also mediate the growth of keratinous rhamphothecae, and the divergence of odontogenic signalling pathways are likely to have accounted for both of these processes. © 2020 American Museum of Natural History Library.

Recent work has identified portions of the avian tree of life that are particularly challenging to reconstruct, perhaps as a result of rapid cladogenesis early in crown bird evolutionary history (specifically, the interval immediately following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction). At face value this hypothesis enjoys support from the crown bird fossil record, which documents the first appearances of most major crown bird lineages in the early Cenozoic-in line with a model of rapid postextinction niche-filling among surviving avian lineages. However, molecular-clock analyses have yielded strikingly variable estimates for the age of crown birds, and conflicting inferences on the impact of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction on the extant bird radiation. This uncertainty has often been ascribed to a patchy avian fossil record, but the possibility of model misspecification in molecular divergence-time analyses represents an important and relatively underexplored alternative hypothesis. Here, we highlight the necessity of further developing and using models that account for coordinated variation in rates of molecular evolution across a phylogeny (e.g., molecular early burst) as a means of assessing support for a rapid post-Cretaceous radiation of crown birds. We discuss how relationships between life history and substitution rates can mislead divergence-time studies that do not account for directional changes in substitution rates over time, and suggest that these effects might have caused some of the variation in existing molecular date estimates for birds. We suggest multiple paths forward that could help resolve this and similar conflicts within other major eukaryotic clades. © 2020 American Museum of Natural History Library.

Largely accepted ecological interpretation ascribes biserial planktic foraminifera as eutrophic and low-oxygen tolerant forms inhabiting the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). However, this ecological interpretation does not agree with all available data from Cenozoic record. Actually, chiloguembelinid stable isotope paleobiology is highly variable through time and space as it indicates mixed-layer habitat on earliest Eocene, middle Eocene and Late Oligocene but thermocline habitat during middle Eocene from northwest Atlantic Ocean. However, chiloguembelinid stable-isotope data were so far lacking from the early Eocene. This interval includes the early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, ~53–48 Ma) that is the crucial time when Earth's surface temperatures and pCO2 reached their maximum levels in the Cenozoic. We present here new chiloguembelinid oxygen and carbon stable-isotope data from early Eocene Atlantic Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 1051, 1258, 1263 and 690. We also generate new data on Chiloguembelina abundance from Site 1051 and compare our record with those previously published from sites 1263 and 1258 in order to correlate the early Eocene paleoceanographic distribution of this genus through the Atlantic Ocean. Interestingly, Chiloguembelina became virtually absent at the beginning of the EECO in the subtropical, equatorial and temperate Atlantic sites. Our findings clearly prove that early Eocene Chiloguembelina occupied a deep-water niche throughout the Atlantic Ocean as demonstrated by its stable isotope signature close to the deep-dweller Subbotina and benthic foraminifera. These evidences provide critical paleoceanographic implications suggesting that intermediate water temperatures probably rose significantly during the EECO thus becoming too warm for this genus. Elevated ocean temperatures enhanced the rate of bacterial respiration and remineralization significantly thus resulting in more efficient recycling of nutrients higher in the water column. This would have induced a restricted food supply deeper in the thermocline and cut out the chiloguembelinid niche. The agreement of the observed decline in abundance of chiloguembelinids at the study sites with recently published foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotope data suggests that enhanced oxygenation of the thermocline in the early EECO might have also played a major role in driving the disappearance of chiloguembelinids, which in itself represent a new evidence for the largely accepted view that these forms inhabited the OMZ. Very likely a combination of reduced food supply, increase in thermocline temperature and oxygen content resulted in the decline of chiloguembelinids in the early EECO. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Atlantic Ocean; Chiloguembelina habitat; Denitrification; Early Eocene Climatic Optimum; Paleoceanography; Planktic foraminifera; Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes,Ecosystems; Food supply; Isotopes; Oxygen supply; Stream flow; Water recycling; Benthic foraminifera; Carbon stable isotopes; Efficient recycling; Intermediate waters; Oxygen minimum zone; Planktic foraminifera; Stable isotope data; Thermocline temperature; Oceanography; Cenozoic; Eocene; historical record; Oligocene; oxygen minimum layer; paleobiology; planktonic foraminifera; stable isotope; thermocline; water temperature; Atlantic Ocean; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chiloguembelina; Chiloguembelinidae; Foraminifera; Subbotina,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085271472,,FALSE,

We reconstruct the historical biogeography of Western Mediterranean vipers to discover the role of climate in fostering diversification. Location: Western Mediterranean Basin. Taxon: Vipera aspis and Vipera latastei-monticola complex. Methods: We used nearly range-wide phylogeographic analyses of three mitochondrial genes followed by geographic assignment of 4,056 records to genetic units to test phylogenetic niche conservatism, under a 3D hypervolume approach, and reconstruct paleoclimatic scenarios for the diversification of main lineages during Pleistocene. Results: Bayesian inferences from mtDNA recovered three Miocene clades and nine Pliocene lineages that diversified during the Pleistocene. Diversification was mostly restricted to southern regions of Iberian and Italian peninsulas and to the north-western African mountains until the late Pliocene. Some lineages expanded northwards during the Pleistocene. Accordingly, genetic diversity was higher in southern regions. Ecological niche tests mostly supported allopatric diversification with niche conservatism, although niche shifts occurred with two divergence events. Palaeoclimatic models identified particular requirements for the current distribution of main lineages and distinct responses to the cooling and warming events of the Pleistocene. Areas of climatic stability during the Pleistocene were identified for main lineages; however, climatic stability was weakly correlated with haplotype diversity. Main conclusions: In the Western Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, palaeo-tectonic and palaeo-climatic factors drove diversification since the Miocene. Comparisons among patterns of diversification, haplotype diversity, and climatic stability suggest that southern Iberian and Italian peninsulas, and north-western African mountains acted as refugia since the Pliocene, while some northern areas favoured population persistence during the Pleistocene.

We first encountered wiregrass in 2014 in the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, a low-elevation steppe protected area in central Oregon. This discovery was incidental to formal vegetation monitoring that was initiated in the monument in 2009. We first encountered wiregrass in monitoring plots in 2016, and, from plot data, we documented rapid spread during 2017-2019. Wiregrass infestation increased within our 4674-ha monitored area from 21 ha (95% CI, 3 to 106 ha) in 2016 to 138 ha (95% CI, 31 to 265 ha) in 2018, and declined to 63 ha (95% CI, 13 to 119 ha) in 2019, representing a cumulative increase of 300% over the 4-year period. Variation in weather may explain this annual variation in wiregrass. We examined mean monthly water balance deficit during the autumn, winter, and spring preceding each survey year and found evidence of a potential correlation between winter deficit and wiregrass. The lowest winter deficit occurred in 2018 prior to the survey documenting the largest wiregrass increase. Wiregrass exhibited a broad ecological niche within our survey area, occurring across all surveyed elevations and on all but steep southern slopes. Invaded sites were in well-drained clay soils in association with other invasive annual grasses. Our observations contribute to the growing evidence that wiregrass poses a greater threat to low-elevation sagebrush ecosystems than previously recognized. It also illustrates the kinds of external stressors that are impacting sagebrush steppe protected areas and the need for continued early detection and rapid response measures, as well as long-term monitoring of invasions and response effectiveness. © 2020.",,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093838932,,FALSE,

We investigated how muscid genera have assembled in the continents by historical dispersal events. Location: Global (except Antarctica). Taxon: Muscidae, Diptera, Insecta. Methods: We compiled a dataset of 181 species, which provided geographic information for 67 genera as terminals. Phylogenetic and geographic data were fitted by five dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis models based on dispersal constraints. Based on the event inferences of the best-fit model, we quantified the direction and frequency of dispersals through time in absolute numbers and in relation to the number of lineages. Results: The best-fit model was ‘unrestricted routes’, which inferred 48 events of dispersals: 66% were trans-climatic events and 81% were transoceanic events. The direction of the dispersals was strongly asymmetric: the Neotropical (NEO) region was the primary source of lineages for all other regions and the Palearctic (PAL) was the secondary source. The relative frequency of dispersal events through time plot was marked by three phases: the early peak of the frequency (40–35 million years ago [Ma]), a valley of low frequencies (30–20 Ma), and the recent peak (15–5 Ma). Trans-climatic dispersals from the NEO to the PAL region occurred in all phases. Lineages of the Cyrtoneurininae showed a low frequency of dispersal events and most of the terminals (11 of 15) were endemic to the NEO region. Conclusion: The Muscidae family originated in the Neotropical region and more recent dispersal events to the Palearctic region established the scenario for lineages to diversify and spread worldwide. Trans-climatic dispersals were more frequent than cis-events and tropical niche conservatism was not the underlying mechanism for the whole clade. We showed that dispersal events between biogeographic regions of the same and different climatic zones were required to achieve the current distribution of extant genera of muscids across the globe. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",biotic interchange; historical biogeography; housefly; model-based; niche conservatism; range expansion; reticulate assemblage; temporal dynamics,biostratigraphy; dispersal; endemism; extratropical environment; fly; Neotropical Region; paleobiogeography; Paleocene-Eocene boundary; phylogenetics; tropical region; Antarctica; Cyrtoneurininae; Diptera; Insecta; Muscidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082118227,,FALSE,

These include the cloud forest biome, subalpine biome and alpine biome found at high elevations in tropical and temperate mountains. Understanding the distribution of biodiversity in highland habitats, as well as the origin of endemic species, provides general insight into the evolutionary processes that generate new species. Major highland areas stretch from the Arctic Circle to the tropical southern border of Mexico, in a complex of old and young mountains. However, these highland areas are isolated from one another, and while highland species appear to be closely related across mountains, distinct endemic species are often found. Geological and paleoecological evidence suggests that past glacial climate fluctuations increased the connectivity of highland habitats, facilitating the movement of highland species during cool and wet climate episodes. Genetic studies of different plant and animal species have shown that the evolution of highland species has been rapid, with the distributional shifts from past climate change facilitating allopatric and peripatric speciation. Furthermore, in some rare cases, evolutionary divergence across steep ecological gradients found on mountain slopes has led to parapatric or sympatric speciation, with some lineages exhibiting adaptive radiation into novel ecological niches. Due to the wealth of biodiversity in these habitats, and the additional importance of highlands for the ecosystem services they provide to human communities, there is considerable concern about ongoing habitat destruction and climate change impacts on North American highlands. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Preliminary evaluations indicate that this vegetation occupies at least 1.8 million of hectares in Mexico, distributed along the rain-shadowed mountain chains of the country, at elevations between oak and pine forests (above), and the xerophytic communities (below). We present a synthesis focusing on historical, paleobotanical and palaeoecological analyses showing that Mediterranean type ecosystems and the Mexical, have a common origin. The archetypal evergreen sclerophyllous vegetation of modern Mediterranean-type vegetation is relictual of the Madrean-Tethyan vegetation of the Paleogene and Neogene periods, which originally existed in a belt around North America and Eurasia when the climate was warm and wet. During a general palaeoclimatic trend towards greater aridity, the Mediterranean climate appeared in the Quaternary when summer precipitation decreased because the oceans became colder and the lands became hotter. The change from tropical to Mediterranean climate led surviving taxa to seek refuge in today's current Mediterranean areas, whereas Mexical did not experience this climatic transition and refuged along the principal mountain chains of Mexico. All these historical effects have been the basis for the analyses about plant ecophysiological studies mostly related to the water economy of evergreen species inhabiting semiarid environments; regeneration niche and community organization; and fire responses of Mexical species.

We present a multi-proxy record from a sediment core from such a lake (Lake Lugu) in southwest China with emphasis on the changes in the testate amoebae community, along with sedimentological data (magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon/TOC and total nitrogen/TN) over the last 2500 years. In total, 29 testate amoebae species belonging to eight genera (Arcella, Centropyxis, Cyphoderia, Difflugia, Netzelia, Phryganella, Pseudodifflugia and Zivkovicia) were identified. Three stages were clearly defined for the lake based on testate amoebae community. The first stage dated to about 500 BCE–800 CE, with the testate amoebae community dominated by Centropyxis and influenced by soil erosion. The second stage (about 800–1920 CE) was characterized by a gradual increase of TOC and TN and an abrupt shift from Centropyxis-dominated to Difflugia-dominated communities. The third stage (about 1920–2010 CE) showed the pronounced impact of environmental change, high proliferation of Difflugia and a strong influence of human activities. Our results suggest that the testate amoebae assemblages in this high-altitude mountain lake are sensitive paleoenvironmental indicators that can help to monitor alpine lake ecosystem change and model lake succession under changing climate and environment. The potential causes of changes in the testate amoebae species composition and three stages of Lake Lugu succession were soil erosion and pollutants. The soil erosion led to the inwash of terrestrial particles and few testate amoebae species into Lake Lugu showing the importance of stochastic processes. The nutrient enrichment from soil erosion generated disturbances in the environment and species competition that led to the proliferation of some species and disappearance of others through niche based deterministic processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Community ecology; Ecological process; Lake Lugu; Sediment multi-proxy; Testate amoebae,Climate models; Ecosystems; Erosion; Lakes; Magnetic susceptibility; Organic carbon; Protozoa; Random processes; Soils; Stochastic systems; Anthropogenic changes; Community ecology; Deterministic process; Ecological process; Multi proxies; Paleoenvironmental indicators; Sedimentological data; Testate amoebae; Climate change; nitrogen; algal bloom; anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic source; lake ecosystem; lake pollution; microbial activity; numerical model; stochasticity; altitude; amoeba (life cycle stage); Arcella; Article; Centropyxis; China; community structure; community succession; controlled study; Cyphoderia; Difflugia; environmental change; human activities; lake; magnetism; Netzelia; nonhuman; paleoenvironment; Phryganella; priority journal; Pseudodifflugia; radiometric dating; sediment; soil erosion; species composition; total organic carbon; Zivkovicia; biodiversity; ecosystem; lake; China; Lugu Lake; Arcella; Centropyxis; Cyphoderia; Difflugia; Phryganella; Pseudodifflugia; Amoeba; Biodiversity; China; Ecosystem; Lakes,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081320088,,FALSE,

This phenomenon represents an important adaptation as it allowed the utilization of the ecological niche given by modern fruits, an abundant source of food that emerged in the terrestrial environment in the Cretaceous. However, identifying the evolutionary events that triggered fermentative capacity in Crabtree-positive species is challenging, as microorganisms do not leave fossil evidence. Thus, key innovations should be inferred based only on traits measured under culture conditions. Here, we reanalyzed data from a common garden experiment where several proxies of fermentative capacity were recorded in Crabtree-positive and Crabtree-negative species, representing yeast phylogenetic diversity. In particular, we applied the “lasso-OU” algorithm which detects points of adaptive shifts, using traits that are proxies of fermentative performance. We tested whether multiple events or a single event explains the actual fermentative capacity of yeasts. According to the lasso-OU procedure, evolutionary changes in the three proxies of fermentative capacity that we considered (i.e., glycerol production, ethanol yield, and respiratory quotient) are consistent with a single evolutionary episode (a whole-genomic duplication, WGD), instead of a series of small genomic rearrangements. Thus, the WGD appears as the key event behind the diversification of fermentative yeasts, which by increasing gene dosage, and maximized their capacity of energy extraction for exploiting the new ecological niche provided by single sugars. © 2020 The Authors.

Using phylogeographic analyses of genome-wide SNPs (34,796 SNPs, 183 individuals) and ecological niche modeling, we inferred population structure, ploidy levels, admixture, and Pleistocene range dynamics of P. tremuloides, and tested several historical biogeographical hypotheses. We found three genetic lineages located mainly in coastal–Cascades (cluster 1), east-slope Cascades–Sierra Nevadas–Northern Rockies (cluster 2), and U.S. Rocky Mountains through southern Canadian (cluster 3) regions of the P. tremuloides range, with tree graph relationships of the form ((cluster 1, cluster 2), cluster 3). Populations consisted mainly of diploids (86%) but also small numbers of triploids (12%) and tetraploids (1%), and ploidy did not adversely affect our genetic inferences. The main vector of admixture was from cluster 3 into cluster 2, with the admixture zone trending northwest through the Rocky Mountains along a recognized phenotypic cline (Utah to Idaho). Clusters 1 and 2 provided strong support for the “stable-edge hypothesis” that unglaciated southwestern populations persisted in situ since the last glaciation. By contrast, despite a lack of clinal genetic variation, cluster 3 exhibited “trailing-edge” dynamics from niche suitability predictions signifying complete northward postglacial expansion. Results were also consistent with the “inland dispersal hypothesis” predicting postglacial assembly of Pacific Northwestern forest ecosystems, but rejected the hypothesis that Pacific-coastal populations were colonized during outburst flooding from glacial Lake Missoula. Overall, congruent patterns between our phylogeographic and ecological niche modeling results and fossil pollen data demonstrate complex mixtures of stable-edge, refugial locations, and postglacial expansion within P. tremuloides.

To transform this industry to be more sustainable, the produced wastewater from a Midwestern beef packing plant was treated by a bench-scale tubular microbial fuel cell (MFC) in continuous fed mode in present study. When the MFC was fed with 1 g L−1 beef extract solution, a maximum current density of 8.8 ± 0.2 A m−3 and organics removal of 28.2 ± 5.9% were observed. Switching feeding solution to real beef packing wastewater did not change system performance considerably. The current density achieved was 8.4 ± 0.2 A m−3 and the organics removal was 35.9 ± 9.7%. Life cycle assessment (LCA) results on operational phase showed that the environmental impact of produced electricity from MFC is minimal compared to the overall electricity consumption. Comparing to the existing on-site treatment infrastructures, adding MFC could reduce global warming by 36%. Also, integrating MFC into the existing on-site wastewater treatment will be less beneficial for fossil fuel depletion due to the less biogas produced, leading to higher requirement of natural gas utilization for heating purpose. The attractiveness of adding alternative energy producing treatment systems to food processors may be based on biogas production and use patterns. © 2020",Anaerobic digestion; Beef packing industry; Life cycle assessment; Microbial fuel cells; Sustainability,Anaerobic digestion; Beef; Biogas; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Life cycle; Natural gasoline plants; Packing plants; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Adding alternatives; Electricity-consumption; Fossil-fuel depletions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Maximum current density; Natural gas utilization; On-site wastewater treatment; Water and energies; Microbial fuel cells,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079347113,,FALSE,

Nexus Informatics develops the science of recognising and quantifying nexus interlinkages. Nexus-coherent solutions enhance the effect of policymaking in achieving adequate governance, leading to successful strategic vision and efficient resource management. In this article, we present the structure of a System Dynamics Model—the Nexus_SDM—that maps sector-specific data from major databases (e.g., EUROSTAT) and scenario models (e.g., E3ME-FTT OSeMOSYS and SWIM) for the national case study of Greece. Disaggregation algorithms are employed on annual national-scale data, turning them into detailed spatial and temporal datasets, by converting them to monthly values spread among all 14 River Basin Districts (RBDs). The Nexus_SDM calculates Nexus Interlinkage Factors and quantifies interlinkages among Water, Energy, Food, Built Environment, Natural Land and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It simulates the nexus in the national case study of Greece as a holistic multi-sectoral system and provides insights into the vulnerability of resources to future socio-economic scenarios. It calculates the link between crop type/area, irrigation water and agricultural value, revealing which crops have the highest agricultural value with the least water and crop area. It demonstrates that fossil fuel power generation and use of oil for transportation are responsible for the most GHG emissions in most RBDs and presents projections for years 2030 and 2050. The analysis showcases that to move from a general nexus thinking to an operational nexus concept, it is important to focus on data availability and scale.

The empirical context was the case of developing biogas production and improving transport in the Trondheim region in Norway. The case consisted of two connected units; establishment of a biogas plant (production side) and development of a sustainable public transport system (use side). As a template for the analysis, the Multilevel Perspective (MLP) on sociotechnical transitions was applied. The core in this perspective is the (sociotechnical) regime level, where changes have to occur in order for sustainable transitions to take place. Central at the regime level is the interaction between actors, technologies and institutions. Transitions can take place if actors experience threats from the external world and have access to niche innovations. Analysis of the case showed that the development first went through a transformation phase (ca. 1990–2009) where R&D actors developed basic technical innovations. In the next phase (2009–2019) there was a reconfiguration process were politicians and market actors engaged. Over the years, this process resulted in significant sustainability outcomes (increased production of biogas and exchange of fossil for biofuels in transport). Three major lessons can be drawn: 1) the crucial role of leadership when it comes to interpreting external changes, timing of actions and coordination of resources, 2) the necessity of new technological innovations and their adoption on regime level, and 3) differentiated state support can develop demand for renewable products and is necessary for compensating extra costs for niche actors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bioeconomy; Multilevel perspective; Renewable fuel; Sociotechnical transitions; Sustainable transport,Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Bioeconomy; Multilevel perspective; Renewable fuels; Socio-technical transitions; Sustainable transport; Biogas,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078150582,,FALSE,

Co-occurrences between these two recognized genera have been documented from some Pleistocene fossil sites in Thailand, suggesting more widely overlapping distribution in the past than today. However, diet and habitat preferences of these Pleistocene and present-day coexisting species have rarely been investigated so far. For the past three decades, stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses become more commonplace in ecological investigations, allowing us to explore the diets and habitats of ancient and extant animals as well as to reconstruct environmental conditions in the past. We reconstructed diets and habitats of these taxa from five fossil sites in Thailand during the past 400,000 years (from the Middle Pleistocene to the Early Holocene) and from some modern wildlife using the isotopic analysis of carbonate in tooth enamel, in order to test species co-occurrence patterns during the Pleistocene and to examine possible changes of their niche breadths over evolutionary time. Our carbon isotope analysis revealed remarkably different ecological patterns between Naemorhedus and Capricornis. The Pleistocene Sumatran serow has been a greater generalist than both the Himalayan and Chinese gorals that fed on pure C4 or mixed C3 and C4 plants restricted to an open landscape habitat and than its extant population that occupies a closed-canopy forest. This suggests that the habitat contraction of the modern wildlife is likely due to the Holocene climate change and the human impacts on Thai ecosystems. In addition to the loss or reduction of grasslands after the latest Pleistocene when rainforests became dominant and besides the human hunting and predation pressure, the high interspecific competition likely contributed to the extirpation of Himalayan gorals in Thailand. Developing a strategic plan for the future biodiversity conservation, a long-term historical isotope approach allowed us to predict the contrasting habitat suitability, a lowland grassland, for these two threatened goral species as testified by their ecological persistence during the Pleistocene. © Copyright © 2020 Suraprasit, Jaeger, Shoocongdej, Chaimanee, Wattanapituksakul and Bocherens.",bulk carbon isotope; goral; paleoecology; Quaternary; refugee; serow; Southeast Asia,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084259500,,FALSE,?

However, combined neontological-palaeontological investigations are mostly limited to large, shelled invertebrates, which keeps our mechanistic understanding of LDGs in its infancy. This paper aims to describe the modern meiobenthic ostracod LDG and to explore the possible controlling factors and the evolutionary mechanisms of this large-scale biodiversity pattern. Location: Present-day Western North Atlantic. Taxon: Ostracoda. Methods: We compiled ostracod census data from shallow-marine environments of the western North Atlantic Ocean. Using these data, we documented the marine LDG with multiple metrics of alpha, beta (nestedness and turnover) and gamma diversity, and we tested whether macroecological patterns could be governed by different environmental factors, including temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH and primary productivity. We also explored the geologic age distribution of ostracod genera to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the LDG. Results: Our results show that temperature and climatic niche conservatism are important in setting LDGs of these small, poorly dispersing organisms. We also found evidence for some dispersal-driven spatial dynamics in the ostracod LDG. Compared to patterns observed in marine bivalves, however, dispersal dynamics were weaker and they were bi-directional, rather than following the ‘out-of-the-tropics’ model. Main conclusions: Our detailed analyses revealed that meiobenthic organisms, which comprise two-thirds of marine diversity, do not always follow the same rules as larger, better-studied organisms. Our findings suggest that the understudied majority of biodiversity may be more sensitive to climate than well-studied, large organisms. This implies that the impacts of ongoing Anthropocene climatic change on marine ecosystems may be much more serious than presently thought. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",benthos; biodiversity; dispersal; macroecology; Ostracoda; temperature,age structure; Anthropocene; benthos; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; dispersal; latitudinal gradient; macroecology; marine environment; niche; ostracod; sensitivity analysis; species diversity; temperature effect; tropical environment; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Bivalvia; Invertebrata; Ostracoda,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078657971,,TRUE,?

These seeps flow across iron duricrusts (referred to as canga in Brazil) into hydraulically restricted lakes in northern Brazil. Canga caps all of the iron ore deposits in Brazil, protecting them from being destroyed by erosion in this active weathering environment. Biofilm samples collected from these seeps demonstrated heightened biogeochemical iron cycling, contributing to the relatively rapid, seasonal formation of iron-rich cements. The seeps support iron-oxidising lineages including Sideroxydans, Gallionella, and an Azoarcus species revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In contrast, a low relative abundance of putative iron reducers; for example, Geobacter species (<5% of total sequences in any sample), corresponds to carbon limitation in this canga-associated ecosystem. This carbon limitation is likely to restrict anoxic niches to within biofilms. Examination of a canga rock sample collected from the edge of Lake Violão revealed an array of well- to poorly-preserved microbial fossils in secondary iron cements. These heterogeneous cements preserved bacterial cell envelopes and possibly extracellular polymeric substances within the microfossil iron-rich cements (termed biocements). Bacterial iron reduction initiates the sequence, and intuitively is the rate-limiting step in this broadly aerobic environment. The organic framework of the active- and paleo-biofilms appears to provide a scaffold for the formation of some cements within canga and likely expedites cement formation. The accelerated development of these resilient iron-rich biocements in the lake edge environment compared with surroundings duricrust-associated environments may provide insights into new approaches to remediate mined land, aiding to stabilise slopes, reduce erosion, restore functional hydrogeology and provide a substrate akin to natural canga for revegetation using endemic canga plant species, which have adapted to grow on iron-rich substrates. © 2019",Biocements; Biofilm; Iron precipitation; Iron reduction; Iron seep; Organic scaffold,"Bacteria; Biofilms; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials preservation; Carbon; Cements; Economic geology; Erosion; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Iron ores; Lakes; Revegetation; RNA; Soil conservation; Soils; Substrates; Weathering; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Aerobic environments; Biocements; Biogeochemical cycling; Extra-cellular polymeric substances; Iron precipitation; Iron reduction; Organic scaffolds; Iron deposits; biocement; cement; iron; iron cement; iron derivative; polymer; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; iron; RNA 16S; biofilm; biogeochemical cycle; cement (construction material); exopolymer; iron; precipitation (chemistry); reduction; seepage; slope stabilization; Article; Azoarcus; bacterial cell; bacterial membrane; bacterial metabolism; biocementation; biofilm; biogeochemical cycling; Brazil; chemical composition; controlled study; DNA determination; ecosystem; ecosystem restoration; environmental factor; environmental parameters; erosion; extracellular space; fossil; Gallionella; Geobacter; geology; hydrogeology; iron metabolism; lake; land remediation; microorganism; mining; nonhuman; oxidation; plant; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); RNA sequence; rock; season; Sideroxydans; slope stabilisation; water analysis; weathering; bacterium; ecosystem; Brazil; Carajas; Para [Brazil]; Azoarcus; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gallionella; Geobacter sp.; Bacteria; Brazil; Ecosystem; Iron; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076530336,,FALSE,

I hypothesize that expansion of one species (the founder) after the last glacial maximum (LGM) into areas that were glaciated has hindered expansion of its competitor (the latecomer). If true, I predict that range and niche sizes of two congeners are more disproportionate within the previously glaciated areas (i.e. the areas of post-glacial expansion) than within areas that were not glaciated. I also predict that niche partitioning is reduced within previously glaciated areas. If true, range and climatic niche overlap of two congeners is smaller in the previously glaciated areas than in non-glaciated areas. Location: North America. Taxon: Non-volant mammals. Methods: I calculate species range size for 87 congeneric species pairs and climatic niche hypervolume for 71 pairs, separately for areas that were and were not glaciated during the LGM. I then compare (a) range and climatic niche size ratio and (b) range and climatic niche overlap for each species pair between areas that were and were not glaciated using a paired t test. Results: Congeneric species pairs exhibit more disproportionate range areas and climatic niche hypervolumes, and smaller range and climatic niche overlap within previously glaciated areas, in comparison with areas that were not glaciated during the LGM. Main conclusions: Interspecific competition has likely hindered post-glacial range expansion of some species into deglaciated areas. Similarly to the founder effect documented on the intraspecific level, the founder species may hinder the expansion of the latecomer. Consequently, one species may expand over very large areas whereas its competitor may expand very little or not at all. Additionally, niche partitioning within the deglaciated areas may be reduced as the founder expands and fills biotopes that would otherwise be utilized by its competitor. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climatic niche; founder effect; last glacial maximum; n-dimensional hypervolume; niche partitioning; species coexistence,deglaciation; founder effect; interspecific competition; mammal; niche overlap; niche partitioning; paleoecology; Postglacial; range expansion; range size; North America; Mammalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077890135,,TRUE,

This is puzzling because tropical ectotherms, being thermal specialists, face a harsher abiotic environment and competition from temperate residents that are thermal generalists. We develop a mathematical framework to address this puzzle. We find that (i) tropical ectotherms can invade temperate habitats if they have higher consumption rates and lower mortality during warmer summers, (ii) stronger seasonal fluctuations at higher latitudes create more temporal niches, allowing coexistence of tropical invaders and temperate residents, and (iii) temperate ectotherms' failure to invade tropical habitats is due to greater mortality rather than lower competitive ability. Our framework yields predictions about population-level outcomes of invasion success based solely on species' trait responses to temperature. It provides a potential ecological explanation for why the tropics constitute both a cradle and a museum of biodiversity. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

However, in the past they adapted to a broad range of ecological niches. For instance, the stratigraphically important middle Paleozoic scyphocrinoids are hypothesized to have been planktonic, employing their inferred gas-filled globular, chambered structure at the distal end of the stem, the so-called lobolith, as a buoyancy device with the crinoid calyx suspended below it. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis using evidence from skeletal micromorphology and theoretical biomechanical modeling. Lobolith walls are typically composed of ossicles, which are exclusively composed of constructional labyrinthic stereom. In plates from the distal side of the lobolith, this stereom extends into microperforate stereom layer, forming wavy ridges and spines. No microscale adaptations for preventing gas leaks and/or ingress of water (such as internal and external imperforate stereom layers) are known. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest that the scyphocrinoid tow-net mode of feeding would have resulted in small relative velocities between the towed filter and the ambient water, thus making it an ineffective passive filter feeder. We suggest that the lobolith of these crinoids acted as a modified holdfast rather than as a floating buoy. Its globular shape and distally positioned microspines served as adaptations for living in unconsolidated sediments, analogous to iceberg- and snowshoe-like strategies used by some mollusks and brachiopods. Like modern isocrinids, scyphocrinoids could have maintained an upright feeding posture by extending the distal portion of the stalk along the bottom. In this recumbent posture, the distal part of the stalk with the lobolith might have functioned as a drag anchor. As a consequence of the ~3-m-long stem, even with this posture, the benthic scyphocrinoids could have risen to the highest epifaunal tier in the Paleozoic. © The Paleontological Society.

We apply an integrative approach to evaluate the role of the environment on the phylogeography of bear species, incorporating fossil data to characterize the changes in the ecological niche through time. We evaluate our approach with the four extant species of bears within Ursus, the best represented taxon in the fossil record of the family Ursidae. Location: Eurasia and North America. Taxa: Asian black bear, Ursus thibetanus; American black bear, U. americanus; Brown bear, U. arctos; and Polar bear, U. maritimus. Methods: We built a genetic and a geographical database from all published mitochondrial DNA sequences and of species occurrence records. We defined the most significant climatic variables based on each species ecological realm using correlation matrices, and characterized the ecological niches and existing environmental conditions with ellipsoid models. We inferred their current and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ecological niche modellings (ENMs) and compared the results with the fossil record. We estimated the times of divergence (d-loop sequences) of lineages and applied a phyloclimatespace approach to discern the phylogeographical patterns along each species’ ecological space. Results: Ecological niche modelling showed wider niches for U. thibetanus and U. americanus encompassing higher temperature and precipitation, while U. arctos and U. maritimus showed an opposite pattern. LGM models were consistent with the fossil record, predicting 55%–89% of the fossil occurrences (within their suitability areas). The phyloclimatespace revealed different degrees of environmental signal in the lineages’ phylogeographical patterns and ecological trajectories associated with LGM climatic conditions. Results indicated habitat tracking and ecological expansion since the LGM towards more extreme precipitation and temperature conditions for three species, except U. maritimus that showed ecological niche reduction. Main Conclusions: Incorporating fossil information from the LGM improved our characterization and interpretation of ecological models, by enabling definition of the limits of the climatic conditions explored by the species in the past. Our approach also provided insights about the existing set of environmental conditions shaping the ecological niche divergence of Ursus bears. We were able to depict key features of the lineages’ evolutionary history, ecology and distribution, revealing the dynamics of niche occupation and the environmental signal on the phylogeographical patterns of Ursus. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",bears; ecological niche; Last Glacial Maximum; lineage diversification; phyloclimatespace; phylogeography; Ursus,bear; divergence; ecological approach; environmental conditions; evolutionary biology; geographical distribution; Last Glacial Maximum; mitochondrial DNA; niche; paleoclimate; phylogeography; Eurasia; North America; Ursidae; Ursus; Ursus americanus; Ursus arctos; Ursus maritimus; Ursus thibetanus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076363447,,TRUE,

These included marsupials that evolved to resemble dogs, hyenas, and saber-toothed cats; gigantic ground sloths and armadillo-like glyptodonts; and an evolutionary radiation of native hoofed mammals that occupied the ecological niches, of mastodonts, rhinos, hippos, horses, camels, rabbits, and many other forms. The isolation persisted until about 10 million years ago, when the first North American groups appeared: mastodonts, tapirs, peccaries, and the extinct deer-like palaeomerycids. Meanwhile, two groups of giant ground sloths made it to Central America. Between 10 and 3.5 million years ago, a few kinds of ground sloths, glyptodonts, capybaras, porcupines, and large predatory birds managed to migrate north to Central and North America, while coatimundi relatives appeared in South America about 7 million years ago, and camelids like llamas about 4 million years ago. By 3.5-2.8 million years ago, the permanent Panama land bridge was formed, and the rest of the “Great American Interchange” occurred. These northern invaders included cats (jaguars, cougars, and saber-toothed cats), dogs (ancestors of the maned wolf and bush dog), bears, skunks, weasels, horses, deer, and additional species of mastodonts, camels, tapirs, and peccaries.

The forest refuge hypothesis postulates that climatic and vegetational upheavals during the Pleistocene fragmented the previously continuous ranges of many species into isolated refuges that would have acted as shelters for rainforest taxa and allowed their survival through the Pleistocene cold stages. This hypothesis has recently been applied to studies of taxa in the African savannahs. We here test this hypothesis using the savannah tree species Senegalia senegal (L.) Briton., which is widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we ask the following questions: (i) Do we find evidence for savannah refugia during the last 130,000 before-present in sub-Saharan Africa? (ii) Would the climate in West Africa already have been suitable for S. senegal prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)? Using 1,132 occurrence records, we modeled the geographic distribution of S. senegal and projected the model into the past using climatic conditions from four time slices spanning the last 130,000 years bp. Our analyses show that the projected geographic extent of S. senegal was broader during the Last Interglacial, with a dramatic decline during the LGM and the subsequent recovery through the mid-Holocene to the present day. Our results indicate a range expansion at least from the mid-Holocene to the present and further show that S. senegal had similarly continuous distribution during the LGM as found today in sub-Saharan Africa. We also assessed the regional variaton of environmental niche occupancy using a principal components analysis (PCA). The PCA reveals variaton in the occupancy of environmental space across sub-Saharan Africa, a key indication of a wide ecological amplitude exhibited by the species.

This is the unavoidable implication of robust analyses of ancient human, omnivorous prey, and microbial genomes, which document long-term—if sporadic—interaction and successful family formation between geographically expanding anatomically modern humans and indigenous Neanderthals. This social and population interaction occurred within a broad time-frame, likely ca. 120–40 ka, involving complex, multi-scalar niche construction and biocultural evolutionary dynamics.

However, it is not yet clear whether reciprocal coevolution between plants and frugivores drove the evolution of their mutualistic interactions. This review aimed at discussing major events of the evolution of fleshy-fruited angiosperms and their major seed dispersers, in order to elucidate if and how they responded to mutual selective pressures. Angiosperms evolved between the Mid and Late Cretaceous and they experienced a large diversification until the early Eocene. However, all main lineages of extant frugivores originated from the Eocene onward: frugivorous birds evolved in the Eocene but diversified in the Oligocene; primates evolved in the early Eocene and frugivorous bats diversified in the Oligocene-Miocene. This divergence in the times of the origins of angiosperm and their modern seed dispersers suggest that other animals interacted with early angiosperms. The most likely candidates are the rodent-like multituberculates. Several studies investigated how plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions contribute to the diversification in both plants and animals and we draw two main hypotheses from them: the plant-frugivore coevolutionary hypothesis and the neutral hypothesis. There are consistent evidences supporting each of these hypotheses, which suggest that they may not be mutually exclusives. An integrative approach is that plant-frugivore coevolution happens in pulses. Times of high environmental disturbances promote significant changes in mutualistic interactions and release new ecological opportunities for emerging species, which in turn exert stronger selective pressures and adaptive changes on fruit and frugivores traits. As evolving frugivores occupies those niches, interactions become more stable and coevolution is weaker and diffuse. We are currently undergoing a new period of unstable plant-frugivore interactions and we need more information on plant-frugivore coevolution in order to predict how species will respond to a changing world. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

However, little is known about their ecology in terms of food preference and niche partitioning. We hypothesize that domestication leads to a new trophic niche for dogs and even for commensal animals, such as foxes, compared to their wild counterparts (i.e. wolves and wild non-commensal foxes). To test our hypothesis, we used stable isotope analysis (δ13C, δ15N) of bone collagen extracted from canid bones from several Magdalenian sites in southwestern Germany and Switzerland (between 17,000 and 13,000 years ago). We then ran Bayesian statistic systems (SIBER, mixSIAR) to reconstruct the trophic niches and diets of Magdalenian canids. We conclude that a significant niche partitioning of canids is reflected in their carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition. Furthermore, we were able to distinguish between the niche of dogs and individual commensal foxes on the one hand, and wolves on the other hand. We suggest that while wolves had permanent, unrestricted access to all types of dietary resources coming from a diversity of prey species, the diet of dogs was controlled by humans. Most of the foxes built their own niche with a diet primarily comprised of small mammals.

This geographic expansion is well studied and can broadly be explained in terms of the movement of pastoralist populations due to climate change. However, no studies have explicitly evaluated changes in the climatic niche of these domesticates. A priori, one cannot assume a relationship between the geographic spread of animal production and changes in climatic niche breadth because their relationship is highly variable. Therefore, we investigated Holocene changes in the climatic niche of domestic animals (animal production) and compared these to changes in the climatic niche of hunted terrestrial ungulates. Location: The African continent. Time period: 9000–500 BP. Major taxa studied: Domestic animals, hunted (wild) terrestrial ungulates. Methods: For the first time, we applied methods from environmental niche dynamics to archaeological data to reconstruct and quantify changes in the climatic niche breadth of animal production during the African Holocene. We used faunal remains from archaeological assemblages and associated radiocarbon dates to estimate the proportion of the African climate space used for animal production and hunting at 500-year intervals. Results: We found that the climatic niche of domestic species broadened significantly with the geographic spread, most notably during the termination of the African Humid Period, whilst no such broadening occurred for the climatic niche of hunted species. Main conclusions: Our results provide a quantitative measure of the extent to which humans have constructed and adapted the climatic niche of animal production to manage their domestic animals across increasingly diverse ecological conditions. By incorporating ecological analysis into estimations of past land use, our methods have the potential to improve reconstructions of land use change, and to provide a foundation on which further niche construction hypotheses may be tested. © 2019 The Authors.

Post-embryonic development of the exoskeleton is well documented for some trilobitomorphs, especially trilobites, but little is known of the ontogeny of their soft parts, limiting understanding of their autecology. Here, we document appendage structure of the Cambrian naraoiid trilobitomorph Naraoia spinosa by computed microtomography, resulting in three-dimensional reconstructions of appendages at both juvenile and adult stages. The adult has dense, strong spines on the protopods of post-antennal appendages, implying a predatory/scavenging behaviour. The absence of such gnathobasic structures, but instead tiny protopodal bristles and a number of endopodal setae, suggests a detritus-feeding strategy for the juvenile.

Here, we collected Quaternary paleo-, palynological, and phylogeographical records from across the TP and applied ecological niche models (ENMs) to obtain a profound understanding of the different adaptation strategies and distributional changes in Abies trees in this unique area. We identified environmental variables affecting the different historical biogeographies of four related endemic Abies taxa and rebuilt their distribution patterns over different time periods, starting from the late Pleistocene. In addition, modeling and phylogeographic results were used to predict suitable refugia for Abies forrestii, A. forrestii var. georgei, A. fargesii var. faxoniana, and A. recurvata. We supplemented the ENMs by investigating pollen records and diversity patterns of cpDNA for them. The overall reconstructed distributions of these Abies taxa were dramatically different when the late Pleistocene was compared with the present. All Abies taxa gradually receded from the south toward the north in the last glacial maximum (LGM). The outcomes showed two well-differentiated distributions: A. fargesii var. faxoniana and A. recurvata occurred throughout the Longmen refuge, a temporary refuge for the LGM, while the other two Abies taxa were distributed throughout the Heqing refuge. Both the seasonality of precipitation and the mean temperature of the driest quarter played decisive roles in driving the distribution of A. fargesii var. faxoniana and A. recurvata, respectively; the annual temperature range was also a key variable that explained the distribution patterns of the other two Abies taxa. Different adaptation strategies of trees may thus explain the differing patterns of distribution over time at the TP revealed here for endemic Abies taxa. © 2019 The Authors.

Faunal difference (β diversity), including spatial heterogeneity, is thought to have played a major role in early Palaeozoic marine diversification, although α diversity is the major determinant of γ diversity through the Phanerozoic. Drivers for this Phanerozoic shift from β to α diversity are not yet resolved. Here, we evaluate the impacts of environmental and faunal heterogeneity on diversity patterns using a global spatial grid. We present early Palaeozoic genus-level α, β and γ diversity curves for molluscs, brachiopods, trilobites and echinoderms and compare them with measures of spatial lithological heterogeneity, which is our proxy for environmental heterogeneity. We find that α and β diversity are associated with increased lithological heterogeneity, and that β diversity declines over time while α increases. We suggest that the enhanced dispersal of marine taxa from the Middle Ordovician onwards facilitated increases in α diversity by encouraging the occupation of narrow niches and increasing the prevalence of transient species, simultaneously reducing spatial β diversity. This may have contributed to a shift from β to α diversity as the major determinant of γ diversity increase over this critical evolutionary interval. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,animal; biodiversity; ecology; evolution; fossil; invertebrate; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Fossils; Invertebrates,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075395273,,FALSE,

More specifically, we test the ‘mountain geobiodiversity hypothesis’ (MGH) which is based on the assumption that it is not mountain-uplift alone which drives the evolution of mountain biodiversity, but rather the combination of geodiversity evolution and Neogene and Pleistocene climate changes. We address the following questions: (a) Do areas of high geodiversity and high biodiversity in mountains overlap, that is can mountain geodiversity predict mountain biodiversity? (b) What is the role of Pleistocene climate change in shaping mountain biodiversity? (c) Did diversification rate shifts occur predominantly with the onset of more pronounced climate fluctuations in the late Neogene and Pleistocene fostering a ‘species pump’ effect, as predicted by the MGH?. Location: Global. Taxon: Vascular plants. Methods: We used generalized linear models to test to what extent vascular plant species diversity in mountains is explained by net primary productivity (NPP), geodiversity and Pleistocene climate fluctuations (i.e. changes in temperature between the Last Glacial Maximum [LGM] and today). In addition, we compiled dates of diversification rate shifts from mountain systems and investigated whether these shifts occurred predominantly before or after the global major climatic fluctuations of the late Neogene and Pleistocene. Results: Both NPP and elevation range show a positive relationship, whereas Pleistocene climatic fluctuations show a negative impact on plant species diversity. The availability of climatic niche space during the LGM differs markedly among mountain systems. Shifts to higher diversification rates or starts of radiations showed the highest concentration from the late Miocene towards the Pleistocene, supporting the MGH. The most commonly inferred drivers of diversification were key innovations, geological processes (uplift) and climate. Main conclusions: Our analyses point towards an important role of historical factors on mountain plant species richness. Mountain systems characterized by small elevational ranges and strong modifications of temperature profiles appear to harbour fewer radiations, and fewer species. In contrast, mountain systems with the largest elevational ranges and stronger overlap between today´s and LGM temperature profiles are also those where most plant radiations and highest species numbers were identified. © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we examine the spatial and temporal context of the evolutionary history of Peperomia (Piperaceae) in the Pacific, where it is one of the largest angiosperm groups (c. 100 species) and a ubiquitous part of wet forests. We focus on the native taxa on the Hawaiian Islands (25 species) where they represent a hotspot of diversity for the genus in the Pacific. Location: Islands of the Pacific, with focus on the Hawaiian Islands. Taxon: Peperomia (Piperaceae). Methods: Phylogenetic analyses of Pacific taxa were performed using full chloroplast genomes for 115 accessions of Peperomia, including 42 Pacific species (∼40% of the diversity in the Pacific). To examine the timing of colonization and diversification of Peperomia in the Pacific, we implemented a Bayesian relaxed-clock model for the Piperales, using multiple fossils in a fossilized-birth death framework. Results: The Hawaiian Islands (and the Pacific) have been colonized by four separate Peperomia lineages originating from the Neotropics. Endemic Hawaiian taxa are derived from independent radiations from two different ancestors, and represent the first documented case of multiple radiations among species-rich plant groups on the Hawaiian Islands. While extant Peperomia originated in the Eocene (∼54.2 million years old, Ma), most lineages in the Pacific are young and originated in the Pliocene (5.33–2.58 Ma), consistent with the ages of the major islands in the Pacific. Main conclusions: The multiple colonizations and radiations of Peperomia in the Pacific attest to the efficacy of their epizoochorous mode of dispersal. The diversification of two clades in parallel on the Hawaiian Islands suggests that the effect of niche-preemption from the earlier-arriving clade on the diversification of the later-arriving lineage has been weak. Ecological release due to the paucity of large native vertebrate herbivores and the relatively open understoreys of Hawaiian wet forests may have allowed both lineages to flourish, and suggests a context-dependent role of niche-preemption in the assembly of oceanic island biotas. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",divergence time estimation; fossilized birth-death model; genome skimming; long-distance dispersal; niche-preemption; Pacific biogeography; Peperomia; Piperaceae,adaptive radiation; angiosperm; chloroplast; colonization; dispersal; Eocene; flora; genome; paleobiogeography; phylogeny; phylogeography; Pliocene; Hawaiian Islands; Pacific Ocean; Magnoliophyta; Peperomia; Piperaceae; Piperales; Vertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073944709,,FALSE,

Location: Palaeotropics. Taxon: Artabotrys (Annonaceae). Methods: Phylogenetic relationships were estimated based on 53 Artabotrys species, using four chloroplast and 10 nuclear markers (c. 15.7 kb). Divergence times were estimated using two fossil calibrations and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model. Ancestral range estimation was performed under a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model while ancestral habitat reconstruction was conducted using the BAYAREALIKE model. Results: Artabotrys is unequivocally monophyletic, with a species-rich main Artabotrys clade (MAC) comprising distinct African and Asian sister clades, and an early divergent grade (EDG) comprising two African species. An ancestral range in Africa is inferred, with a single dispersal to Asia. The PID at the MAC crown occurred in the Miocene. A broad habitat tolerance spanning rain forests and seasonally dry forests/savannas was inferred at the MAC stem and crown nodes. Several shifts from rain forests to seasonally dry habitats were inferred, but there is no indication of a reverse transition. Main conclusions: The most plausible explanation for the PID involves overland migration across Arabia in the Miocene, prior to subsequent climate deterioration. Long-standing differences in climatic niche may have resulted in a significant yet porous biogeographical divide at the Isthmus of Kra, but Wallace's line does not reflect differences in climatic niches.

In Germany, a structural change commission has proposed a complete phase-out of coal by 2038. For the city of Leipzig, which is located in a mining region, this opens up the possibility of a post-fossil transformation. Leipzig started an energetic retrofitting process within its housing sector several years ago, and is now planning to phase-out coal-fired district heating as early as 2023. This heat transition could turn Leipzig into one of the pioneering cities of post-fossil transformation.

In addition, our paper outlines the main interests and goals of the key actors and stakeholders in this transition, as well as their competences and resources. We emphasize that while Leipzig has committed itself to ambitious climate goals, up to now, the city has had no systemic approach for reducing local emissions.

The δ13C analyses suggest a generalist diet for Notiomastodon platensis, Palaeolama major, Holmesina paulacoutoi and Glyptotherium sp., while Equus neogeus was a grazer with a diet consisting exclusively of C4 grasses, and Eremotherium laurillard, a predominant browser with a diet consisting predominantly of C3 plants. A distinct diet pattern was inferred for one species: Toxodon platensis with a mixed-diet preferring C4 grasses in Mato Grosso do Sul but predominantly the C3 feeder in Bahia. These results show a high ecological plasticity of this species and may suggest distinct ecological pressures or different vegetation configurations in the two regions. Diet reconstitutions based on δ13C analyses suggest that an open savanna-like landscape predominated in both areas. The δ18O values reveal that Mato Grosso do Sul could have experienced wetter climatic conditions than Bahia during the Late Quaternary, suggesting a humid corridor in midwestern Brazil, or that there were different contents of δ18O of water sources between these areas. Hence, we assume that the same faunistic composition in different geographical areas is not enough to delimit the ecosystems of the BIR, and we recommend that the definitions of BIR should be revised to include more refined paleoclimate data.

The underlying mechanisms and timing have remained unclear to date. The evolutionary history of Quercus section Ilex Loudon, a representative East Asian-Tethyan disjunct lineage with a rich and widespread fossil record, was investigated to understand the key drivers of this disjunction. Location: Eurasia. Methods: The phylogeny of Quercus section Ilex was reconstructed using RAD-seq. Divergence times were estimated based on three fossil calibrations. Ancestral range and niche were reconstructed on the calibrated tree to infer the timing of transitions in geographic distributions and niche. Convergence in ecological space was estimated by fitting alternative multiple-regime Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Leaf shape affinities among extant and fossil taxa of section Ilex were assessed using geometric morphometric approaches. Results: Six clades were well resolved in section Ilex. Ancestral range reconstruction and divergence time dating suggest a wide distribution along the East Tethys seaway, with initial divergence at the mid-Eocene, and all six clades originating before the Miocene. The section dispersed from East Asia to the Mediterranean at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A shift toward higher elevations was detected in the Himalayan clade during the middle or late Miocene. European fossil lineages during the early Miocene differ in leaf morphology from later lineages, which we infer to be a consequence of adaptive differentiation or species turnover. Main conclusions: Quercus section Ilex was widespread along the East Tethys seaway from the middle Eocene onward. The European holly oaks originated from an East Asian ancestral lineage that dispersed to Europe via the Tibet-Himalaya corridor in the Oligocene. Lowlands along the margins of the Himalayas and through an Oligocene Tibetan valley served as the dispersal route(s) for these species. Changing climates drove Miocene extinction and local adaptation of European lineages. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",biogeography; Cenozoic; East Asian-Tethyan disjunction; geometric morphometrics; phylogenomics; RAD-seq; species dispersal,Cenozoic; deciduous tree; dispersal; divergence; Eocene; extinction; fossil record; genetic algorithm; genetic analysis; morphometry; paleobiogeography; paleobotany; phylogeography; Tethys; China; Eurasia; Far East; Himalayas; Xizang; Ilex; Quercus; Quercus ilex,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068741205,,FALSE,

By extracting natural resources, they shape their environment and also that of plants and other animals. A great difference setting people apart from all other living beings is the ability to construct and develop their own niche intentionally, and the unique tool for this is cultural behaviour. Here, we discuss anthropogenic environmental changes of hunter-gatherers and present new palaeoecological and palynological data. The studies are framed with ethnoarchaeological data from Western Siberia to gain a better understanding of how different triggers lead to coping mechanisms. For archaeological implication, we use two Mesolithic case studies from Germany: One of them focuses on hazelnut economy around ancient Lake Duvensee, and the other broaches the issue of selective roe deer hunt and its consequences at the site of Friesack. We address the archaeological evidence from the perspective of active alteration and its consequences, starting our argumentation from a perspective of niche construction theory. This approach has rarely been applied to early Holocene hunter-gatherers in Northern Europe even though the available data render possible to discuss human–environment interaction from such a perspective. It is demonstrated that archaeological research has tools at hand that enables to detect anthropogenic niche construction. However, the ethnoarchaeological example shows limitations and archaeologically invisible triggers and consequent results of human adaptations. The critical revision of such perspectives based on empirical data provides a better understanding of social and environmental transformations in the early- and mid-Holocene. © The Author(s) 2019.",ethnoarchaeology; hunter-gatherers; Mesolithic; niche construction theory; Northern Germany; pollen analysis; Siberia; zooarchaeology,adaptation; anthropology; archaeology; forest ecosystem; Holocene; hunter-gatherer; Mesolithic; natural resource; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; palynology; Germany; Northern Europe; Siberia; Animalia; Capreolus; Corylus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068327845,,FALSE,

This paper systematically documents seventeen ichnogenera and three ichno-types coupled with plant fossils (mainly equisetaceous stems and roots) from the fluvial–lacustrine Late Permian to Middle Triassic Shichuanhe section in North China. These ichnofossils constitute several ichnoassemblages, including resting traces (Lockeia), locomotion traces (Diplichnites, Kouphichnium, Protovirgularia), dwelling traces (Arenicolites, Camborygma, Macanopsis, Palaeophycus, Skolithos), grazing traces (Gordia, Helminthoidichnites, Monomorphichnus) and feeding traces (Planolites, Scoyenia, Spongeliomorpha, Taenidium) and some of them were scarcely reported in the coeval sediments of North China. The ichnological criteria, such as ichnodiversity, intensity of bioturbation, and burrow size and depth, exhibit a significant reduction in the latest Permian rocks, accompanied by simplification of trace maker ethology. These signals initially rebound in the early Early Triassic, when the behavioral generalists opportunistically occupied the empty niches and constructed simple but deep Skolithos. A full reconstruction of continental ecosystems should take place in the late Early Triassic to Middle Triassic, with high ichnodiversity, intensive bioturbation and behavior complexity of trace producers. The small, simple but deep burrows occurring in the early Early Triassic would be the ecological responses of the animals to the lethal heat in the terrestrial facies. © 2019",continental; North China; Permian–Triassic transition; trace fossils,Biology; continental; Ecological response; Late Permian; Mass extinction; North China; Secular variation; Trace fossils; Triassic; Ecosystems; fluviolacustrine deposit; grazing; ichnofacies; ichnology; locomotion; Permian-Triassic boundary; succession; trace fossil; China; Shaanxi; Animalia; Arenicolites; Camborygma; Diplichnites; Helminthoidichnites; Kouphichnium; Monomorphichnus; Palaeophycus; Planolites; Scoyenia; Skolithos; Taenidium,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067402479,,FALSE,?

Our simulations show that these hypotheses are non-mutually exclusive and that their relative influence depends on the time scale considered. Simulations suggest that reef habitat dynamics produced the LDG during deep geological time, while ecological constraints shaped the modern LDG, with a strong influence of the reduction in the latitudinal extent of tropical reefs during the Neogene.

Mammuthus shows a wide variety of dietary strategies, with an overall trend from browsing to grazing through the lineage from M. rumanus to M. primigenius. Nonetheless there is significant inter-population variability which is clearly related to the resources available or to limitations imposed by competition and niche partitioning with other large herbivores.

Our palaeo-environmental analysis of two sedimentary cores obtained from a lagoon in close proximity to four caves, occupied by human groups during the transition from hunting and gathering to food-producing ways of life in this region, confirms Charles McBurney's 1968 hypothesis that when Caspian Sea levels were high, Mesolithic hunters were reliant on seal and deer, but as water levels receded and a wide coastal plain emerged, hunters consumed a different range of herbivorous mammalian species. Palynological evidence obtained from these two cores also demonstrates that the cool and dry climatic conditions often associated with the Younger Dryas stadial do not appear to have been extreme in this region. Thus, increasingly sedentary hunting and gathering groups could have drawn on plant and animal resources from multiple ecological niches without suffering significant resource stress or reduced population levels that may have been encountered in neighbouring regions. Our analyses of botanical, faunal and archaeological remains from a recently-discovered open-air Mesolithic and aceramic Neolithic site also shows an early process of Neolithization in the southern Caspian basin, which was a very gradual, low-cost adaptation to new ways of life, with neither the abandonment of hunting and gathering, nor a climatic trigger event for the emergence of a low-level, food-producing society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Archaeology; Caspian Sea levels; Faunal and botanical evidence; Human response; Middle East; Neolithization; Palaeogeography; Palynology; Pleistocene-Holocene transition; Vegetation dynamics,Mammals; Water levels; Archaeology; Caspian sea; Faunal and botanical evidence; Human response; Middle East; Neolithization; Palaeogeography; Palynology; Pleistocene-Holocene transition; Vegetation dynamics; Sea level; anthropogenic effect; archaeology; coastal plain; environmental change; Mesolithic; Neolithic; paleogeography; palynology; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; vegetation history; Caspian Sea; Elburz; Iran; Middle East; Animalia; Cervidae; Mammalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068539298,,FALSE,?

We studied a plinthic horizon to determine how different micro-zones in a horizon affect the bacterial community. The plinthic horizon is a net-like horizon characterized by the segregation of iron forms as shown by contrasting red matrix and white veins, which share common macro-environmental conditions such as climate and land use but differ only in physical and chemical compositions. The studied horizon is typical of the red soils of southeastern China and is an important layer in the red soil Critical Zone. The plinthite is considered to have been formed in the Quaternary and thus is a record of the paleo-environment. We evaluated the difference in the bacterial community composition between the red matrix and white veins and explored the possible assembly mechanisms of their co-occurrence patterns. Compared to the eutrophic environments of a red matrix, higher relative abundances of Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae were observed in the white veins. Similarly, more niches led to a higher density of bacterial co-occurrence patterns in the red matrix. The differences in the bacterial community composition and association networks are due to environmental selection, including the legacy of the paleoclimate that is represented by major element contents and contemporary hydrological properties that are mainly controlled by the soil texture. Our study shows that micro-zones even within a same plinthic horizon can provide different habitats and thus select for specific bacterial communities. Furthermore, this study could improve our understanding of the differentiation of bacterial communities among microenvironments caused by both historical and contemporary processes and help to predict how these communities may respond to future environmental changes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Co-occurrence network; Environmental selection; Net-like horizon; PICRUSt; Random forest; Soil texture,Bacteriology; Decision trees; Land use; Soils; Textures; Co-occurrence networks; Environmental selection; Net-like horizon; PICRUSt; Random forests; Soil textures; Bacteria; iron; nitrogen; organic carbon; RNA 16S; chemical composition; community composition; environmental factor; forest soil; habitat selection; microbial activity; microbial community; soil microorganism; soil texture; Acidobacteria; Alcaligenaceae; Article; bacterial count; bacterial gene; bioinformatics; chemical composition; China; climate; Corynebacteriaceae; Corynebacterium; ecological niche; environmental change; environmental factor; eutrophication; Flavobacteriales; gene amplification; habitat; inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry; land use; microbial community; Micrococcaceae; Micrococcus; microenvironment; Nitrospirae; nonhuman; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; population abundance; prediction; priority journal; Propionibacteriaceae; Propionibacterium; Quaternary (period); Rhodospirillaceae; sequence analysis; soil analysis; soil microflora; soil texture; Sphingomonas; strain difference; bacterium; chemistry; classification; microbiology; microflora; soil; Acidobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Nitrospirae; Bacteria; China; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065249190,,FALSE,

An alternative explanation for differences in dietary specialization across the continents is derived from phylogeographic distribution patterns, rather than savanna vegetation types. Body size is one of the most fundamental traits influencing animal physiology, ecology, and evolution. The evolution of body size distributions among herbivores is usually considered in relation to feeding behavior and digestive physiology. Large mammal herbivores are a taxonomically diverse group of animals, occupying a diverse array of dietary niches. Gaps and taphonomic biases in the fossil record present a challenge for understanding bottom-up drivers of diversification, especially at scales other than global; even comparisons over intercontinental scales are subject to this limitation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Body size; Cainozoic mammal herbivores; Digestive physiology; Feeding behavior; Large mammal herbivores; Savanna environments,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102046926,,FALSE,?

Here, we asked whether coastal heath vegetation established in stressful habitats could be assembled by quasi-neutral mechanisms based on functional trait distribution. Communities are organized through quasi-neutral dynamics if abiotic gradients and/or species interactions impose sorting on functional traits and species performances, but not on species phylogenetic relatedness and occurrence. Methods: The study was conducted in a coastal area containing tall dunes near the sea, and relatively flat areas punctuated by short palaeodunes further inland, Northeastern South America. We evaluated 10 traits of the 21 most abundant species, as well as eight abiotic variables in 70 plots (25 m2) established in dune tops, valleys, flat and steep microenvironments. The effect of environmental filter was tested by linear mixed models (LMM) between each community-weighted mean (CWM) trait and the abiotic variables, and by two indices of environmental filtering based on intra- and interspecific-trait variability relative to null models. To evaluate the effect of species interactions, we used an index of niche overlap relative to null models, and LMMs between this index and the species richness of plots. Important Findings: The environmental filtering index did not deviate from null expectations for any trait. Models that included individual variability performed similarly to models that used species mean traits. However, the explicit consideration of environmental gradients by CWM analyses revealed functional patterns that would remain undetected if trait distribution was analyzed only. In addition, intraspecific variation in the stem length was an important driver of species diversity as suggested by the relationship between species richness and the niche overlap index. Based on the occurrence and phylogenetic relatedness of species, previous work in the same system found neutral community assembly. We concluded that to ignore functional traits may lead to underestimations of niche-based processes, and that analyses of species occurrence and phylogenetic relatedness should be complemented with functional traits to reinforce our interpretation of processes underpinning community assembly. In this regard, the study heath vegetation is influenced by quasi-neutral effects on functional trait distribution. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

To date, there have been numerous studies of niche differentiation in local ant communities, but little attention has been given to the macroecology of niche differentiation, including the extent to which particular biomes show distinctive patterns of niche structure across their global ranges. We investigated patterns of niche differentiation and competition in ant communities in tropical rainforests, using different baits reflecting the natural food spectrum. We examined the extent of temporal and dietary niche differentiation and spatial segregation of ant communities at five rainforest sites in the neotropics, paleotropics, and tropical Australia. Despite high niche overlap, we found significant dietary and temporal niche differentiation in every site. However, there was no spatial segregation among foraging ants at the community level, despite strong competition for preferred food resources. Although sucrose, melezitose, and dead insects attracted most ants, some species preferentially foraged on seeds, living insects, or bird feces. Moreover, most sites harbored more diurnal than nocturnal species. Overall niche differentiation was strongest in the least diverse site, possibly due to its lower number of rare species. Both temporal and dietary differentiation thus had strong effects on the ant assemblages, but their relative importance varied markedly among sites. Our analyses show that patterns of niche differentiation in ant communities are highly idiosyncratic even within a biome, such that a mechanistic understanding of the drivers of niche structure in ant communities remains elusive. © 2019 The Authors.

We hypothesize that the orogeny during the Oligocene-Miocene combined with global cooling led to the origin and early diversification of cold-adapted plant lineages in these regions. Before the establishment of the Arctic cryosphere, adaptation and speciation in high elevation areas of these mountain ranges may have led to higher species richness compared to the Arctic. Subsequent colonization from mid-latitude mountain ranges to the Arctic may explain similar but poorer flora. Location: Arctic-Alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Methods: We mapped the cold climate in the Northern Hemisphere for most of the Cenozoic (60 Ma until present) based on paleoclimate proxies coupled with paleoelevations. We generated species distribution maps from occurrences and regional atlases for 5,464 plant species from 756 genera occupying cold climates. We fitted a generalized linear model to evaluate the association between cold-adapted plant species richness and environmental, as well as geographic variables. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of studies which inferred and dated the ancestral geographic origin of cold-adapted lineages using phylogenies. Results: We found that the subalpine-alpine areas of the mid-latitude mountain ranges comprise higher cold-adapted plant species richness than the Palearctic and Nearctic polar regions. The topo-climatic reconstructions indicate that the cold climatic niche appeared in mid-latitude mountain ranges (42–38 Ma), specifically in the Himalayan region, and only later in the Arctic (22–18 Ma). The meta-analysis of the dating of the origin of cold-adapted lineages indicates that most clades originated in central Asia between 39–7 Ma. Main conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that the orogeny and progressive cooling in the Oligocene-Miocene generated cold climates in mid-latitude mountain ranges before the appearance of cold climates in most of the Arctic. Early cold mountainous regions likely allowed for the evolution and diversification of cold-adapted plant lineages followed by the subsequent colonization of the Arctic. Our results follow Humboldt's vision of integrating biological and geological context in order to better understand the processes underlying the origin of arctic-alpine plant assemblages. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",arctic; biodiversity; climate change; cold-adapted plants; flora; mountain; orogeny,adaptation; biodiversity; Cenozoic; climate; climate change; colonization; cooling; evolution; flora; midlatitude environment; Miocene; mountain region; Northern Hemisphere; Oligocene; paleoclimate; phylogeny; plant community; species richness; Arctic; Central Asia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069754442,,TRUE,

Predicting the distribution of species under climate change is important for conservation of biodiversity. The aim of this research was to model the current distribution of miombo woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa using seventeen miombo tree species, and to project their distributions under different climate change scenarios. A maximum entropy method, Maxent, was used to model the distributions of the seventeen representative tree species, Albizia antunesiana, Afzelia quanzensis, Baikiaea plurijuga, Brachystegia bakeriana, Brachystegia boehmii, Brachystegia longifolia, Brachystegia microphylla, Brachystegia spiciformis, Brachystegia utilis, Cryptosepalum exfoliatum, Guibourtia coleosperma, Isoberlinia angolensis, Julbernadia globiflora, Julbernadia paniculata, Pericopsis angolensis Pterocarpus angolensis, and Pterocarpus rotundifolius. A total of 3 429 occurrence records, nineteen bioclimatic variables, monthly precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures, soil characteristics and altitude were used in modeling. Distributions were hindcasted to the Mid-Holocene and forecasted to 2050 and 2070 under all four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Hindcasting showed that ranges for A. antunesiana, B. bakeriana, B. boehmii, C. exfoliatum, G. coleosperma and Pterocarpus angolensis were larger in the Mid-Holocene than they are currently, while the ranges of the other species were constricted during this period. When forecasted, range contraction was observed for nine species, A. quanzensis, A. antunesiana, B. microphylla, B. spiciformis, B utilis, C. exfoliatum, J. globiflora, Pericopsis angolensis and P. rotundifolius. Range expansion was observed in the other eight species. Range contraction was acute in 2070 under RCP8.5 for A. quanzensis (-13%), A. antunesiana (-15%) and B. microphylla (-14%). Species whose forecasted ranges contracted should be prioritized for mitigation against climate change. All species should be protected from anthropogenic threats since most are unsustainably harvested. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH",Climate change; Ecological Niche Modeling; Maxent; Mid-Holocene; Miombo woodlands; Representative Concentration Pathway,angiosperm; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; ecological modeling; geographical distribution; Holocene; niche; prediction; range expansion; woodland; Sub-Saharan Africa; Afzelia quanzensis; Albizia; Baikiaea plurijuga; Brachystegia; Brachystegia boehmii; Brachystegia longifolia; Brachystegia spiciformis; Cryptosepalum; Guibourtia coleosperma; Isoberlinia; Pericopsis angolensis; Pterocarpus angolensis; Pterocarpus rotundifolius,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067807666,,TRUE,

Here, we quantify rates of change in mean cold tolerances, and contributions of colonization and local extinction to those rates, recorded in plant macrofossil assemblages from North American hot deserts over the last 30,000 years. Location: Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Time period: 30–0 thousand years before present (kybp). Major taxa studied: Vascular plants. Methods: Colonization and local extinction dates for 269 plant species were approximated from macrofossils in 15 packrat (Neotoma) midden series. Cold tolerances estimated from contemporary climate were used to quantify assemblage-mean cold tolerances through time. Rates of colonization and local extinction, and their effects on rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances, were estimated for 30–20 kybp (Late Pleistocene, no directional warming), 20–10 kybp (deglaciation, rapid warming) and 10–0 kybp (Holocene, no directional warming). Results: Rates of change in all metrics were negligible during the Late Pleistocene. Rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances (mean 1.0°C × 10−4/yr) lagged behind warming during deglaciation, and continued at similar rates (1.2°C × 10−4/yr) throughout the Holocene. Colonization and local extinction contributed equally to delayed responses to warming, but their dynamics differed through time: Colonization by warm-adapted species predominated during deglaciation, while the most heat-adapted species exhibited long delays in colonization. Only the most cold-adapted species went locally extinct during deglaciation, followed by slow repayment of the extinction debt of cool-adapted species during the Holocene. Main conclusions: Responses to rapid warming can persist for millennia, even after cessation of warming. Consistent patterns from different midden series across the region support a metacommunity model in which dispersal interacts with environmental filters and buffers against local extinction to drive community–climate disequilibrium during and after periods of warming. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate change; climate niche; community assembly; dispersal limitation; extinction debt; palaeoecology,climate effect; climate variation; colonization; community dynamics; dispersal; extinction; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoclimate; paleoecology; plant; Chihuahuan Desert; Mojave Desert; Sonoran Desert; United States; Neotoma; Tracheophyta,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067413093,,TRUE,?

Owing to the need to evolve these complex adaptations, transitioning from tropical to temperate climates is regarded as difficult. Here, we study the transition from tropical to temperate climates in the grass subfamily Pooideae, which dominates cool temperate, continental and Arctic regions. We produce a dated phylogeny and investigate the role of climate cooling in diversification. Location: Global, temperate regions. Time period: Cretaceous–Cenozoic. Major taxa: Pooideae. Methods: Using newly available fossils and methods, we dated a comprehensive Pooideae phylogeny and tested for the impact of palaeoclimates on diversification rates. Using ancestral state reconstruction, we investigated whether Pooideae ancestors experienced frost and winter. To locate the ancestral distribution area of Pooideae, we performed biogeographical analyses. Results: We estimated a Late Cretaceous/early Palaeocene origin of the Pooideae (61–77 Ma), with all major clades already having diversified at the Eocene–Oligocene climate cooling (34 Ma). Climate cooling was a probable driving force of Pooideae diversification. Pooideae probably evolved in a temperate niche experiencing frost, but not long winters. Main conclusion: Pooideae probably originated in a temperate niche and experienced cold temperatures and frost long before expansion of temperate biomes after the Eocene–Oligocene transition. This suggests that the Pooideae ancestor had adaptations to temperate climate and that certain responses to low-temperature stress are shared in extant Pooideae grasses. Throughout the Cenozoic, falling temperatures and expansion of temperate biomes were associated with an increase in diversification. However, complex mechanisms for enduring strongly seasonal climate with long, cold winters most probably evolved independently in daughter lineages.

Understanding how these species responded to historical climatic changes is important for understanding community assembly mechanisms with evolutionary and conservation implications. However, the location of refugial areas and postglacial history of widespread trees in East Asia remain poorly known. We combined microsatellite data (63 populations, 1756 individuals) and ecological niche modeling to examine the range-wide population diversity, genetic structure, and historical demography of a pioneer tree species, Asian white birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.) across East Asia. We found a north-to-south trend of declining genetic diversity and five clusters, corresponding to geographical regions. Different clusters were inferred to have diverged through Pleistocene climatic oscillations and have different expansion routes, leading to genetic admixture in some populations. Ecological niche models indicated that the distribution of B. platyphylla during the last glacial maximum still had a large latitude span with slight shifts toward southeast, and northern populations had more variable distribution ranges than those in the south during later climatic oscillations. Our results reflect the relatively stable distribution through the last glacial–interglacial cycles and recent multidirectional expansion of B. platyphylla, providing new hypotheses for the response pattern of widespread tree species to climate change. The gradual genetic pattern from northeast to southwest and alternative distribution dynamics possibly resulted from environmental differences caused by latitude and topographic heterogeneity. © 2019 The Authors.

Indeed, the niches of some Afromontane trees are up to 50% larger after incorporation of fossil data. This expansion could reduce estimates of species' future range loss owing to climate change but also implies strong non-climatic limitations on species' current ranges. One such limitation is land use, which fossil data suggest influences Afromontane tree distribution, preventing these trees from occupying warmer conditions than they do currently. We aimed to assess the degree to which the broader climatic tolerances revealed by fossil data buffer projected range loss from climate and land use for Afromontane trees. Location: Africa. Time period: Last 21,000 years. Major taxa studied: Afromontane trees. Methods: We used species distribution models informed by both current and fossil distributions to project future ranges under climate and land-use projections. Results: We found that projected range reductions are only slightly ameliorated by incorporation of fossil distributions, and these improvements diminish further under severe land-use or climate change scenarios. Taxa that are less impacted by climate are more impacted by intense land use. Depending on the severity of climate and land use, the geographical extent of Afromontane tree species' ranges will contract by 40–85%, and the trees will be completely lost from large portions of Africa. We projected that the surviving species' ranges will become increasingly fragmented. Main conclusions: Maintaining Afromontane ecosystems will require mitigation of both climate and land-use change and protection of areas to optimize connectivity.

Yet numerous phylogeographical studies of EBLF plants have inferred glacial refugia north of this area. Here, we aim to further elucidate the Quaternary dynamics of EBLFs using the widespread shrub Lindera aggregata as model. Location: Subtropical China. Taxon: Lindera aggregata (Sims) Kosterm (angiosperms). Methods: Four chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments and 15 low-copy nuclear genes (LCGs) were sequenced in 19 populations. The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was estimated using secondary calibrations. Bayesian algorithms were used to infer population clustering, phylogeny and divergence time. Historical gene flow was estimated using a maximum-likelihood algorithm. Potential habitats at present and during the LGM were predicted using ecological niche modelling. Results: The TMRCA estimate was 1.78 Myr. We observed a shallow cpDNA network organized around one dominant haplotype. The LCGs revealed three distinct genetic clusters that reflected contrasting historical population dynamics. The most ancient cluster was located south of the Nanling and Wuyi Mountains and indicated long-term population persistence in multiple refugia. The area further north was occupied by two disjunct clusters that dated back to the LGM and showed signatures of a rapid northward expansion from two refugia. We detected noteworthy pollen-mediated secondary admixture between all three clusters including somewhat preferential southward gene flow. Main conclusions: Lindera aggregata represents a rare example of extensive post-glacial range expansion across the EBLF biome (expansion-contraction model) that contrasts with its generalized long-term population stability in the southernmost range parts. Our findings also provide rare evidence for noteworthy post-glacial gene flow into long-term refugial populations. They correspond relatively well with palaeo-biome reconstructions and support the hypothesis that the EBLF has undergone extensive post-glacial community reshuffling. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",evergreen broadleaved forests; genetic break; Lindera aggregata; microrefugia; range expansion; secondary admixture; southern refugia model,broad-leaved forest; chloroplast; common ancestry; DNA; evergreen forest; evergreen tree; gene flow; Last Glacial Maximum; phylogeny; phylogeography; Postglacial; refugium; shrub; subtropical region; China; Fujian; Nanling; Wuyi Mountain; Lauraceae; Lindera aggregata; Magnoliophyta,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064525300,,TRUE,

There are many ways to conceptualize the recovery of the biosphere; here, we focus on the global recovery of species diversity. Mass extinction may be expected to be followed by rapid speciation, but the fossil record contains many instances where speciation is delayed—a phenomenon about which we have a poor understanding. A probable explanation for this delay is that extinctions eliminate morphospace as they curtail diversity, and the delay in diversification is a result of the time needed for new innovations to rebuild morphospace, which can then be filled out by new species. Here, we test this morphospace reconstruction hypothesis using the morphological complexity of planktic foraminifer tests after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene mass extinction. We show that increases in complexity precede changes in diversity, indicating that plankton are colonizing new morphospace, then slowly filling it in. Preliminary diversification is associated with a rapid increase in the complexity of groups refilling relict Cretaceous ecospace. Subsequent jumps in complexity are driven by evolutionary innovations (development of spines and photosymbionts), which open new niche space. The recovery of diversity is paced by the construction of new morphospace, implying a fundamental speed limit on diversification after an extinction event. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate; evolution; fossil; paleontology; species extinction; Biological Evolution; Climate; Extinction, Biological; Fossils; Paleontology",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064004534,,FALSE,

Nonetheless, the early Miocene fossil record of low-latitude vertebrates is scarce; hence, crocodylians remain poorly known in the region. The Castillo Formation, located in the northwest of Venezuela, preserves an interesting vertebrate fauna with a well-constrained late early Miocene age. Previous work dealing with crocodylians of this formation only recorded three taxa: the gavialoid Siquisiquesuchus venezuelensis and Gryposuchus sp. and indeterminate alligatoroid remains. New cranial and mandibular material recently recovered from the Castillo Formation allows us to document four previously unrecognised alligatoroid forms: Purussaurus sp., Caiman sp., an indeterminate caimanine and an indeterminate alligatoroid. With six taxa, the crocodylian assemblage reveals a previously undocumented relatively high taxonomic diversity in the early Miocene. The Castillo crocodylians show a broad range of morphological disparity and body sizes ranging from small (2.5 m–62 kg) to large (7.5 m–1600 kg) taxa. Thus, crocodylian niche partition, as well as the abundance and variety of resources and environmental heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems in South America, were already established by at least the early Miocene. The presence of Caiman in ~ 18 Ma strata represents the unequivocally earliest record of the taxon in South America and allows us to propose that the origin of the jacareans is more likely to have occurred during or before the early Miocene, challenging previous molecular hypotheses. © 2018, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Alligatoroids; Caimaninae; Castillo formation; Early Miocene; South America,aquatic ecosystem; crocodilian; fossil assemblage; fossil record; heterogeneity; Miocene; morphology; reptile; taxonomy; vertebrate; Venezuela; Alligatoroidea; Caiman; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Vertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048305107,,FALSE,

The long-term paleoecology and possible foraging competition of these two species have not been intensively investigated yet. Here, we applied stable isotope (C, O) analysis to the tooth enamel of coexisting Elephas maximus, Stegodon orientalis, and other associated mammalian species in Quzai Cave, southern China, dated to the early Late Pleistocene, to explore their paleoenvironmental context and foraging ecology. The δ 13 C values of Elephas maximus were widely distributed between −17.9‰ and −11.9‰ (n = 10), while Stegodon orientalis δ 13 C values ranged from −16.7‰ to −14.7‰ (n = 7). These results suggest that Elephas maximus was possibly a mixed feeder with a broader range of dietary resources than Stegodon orientalis, which probably browsed on a narrower range of plant resources in more densely forested landscape. A chronological comparison (from 8 Ma to recent) of published δ 13 C data for these two species from Asia showed that none of them were dietary specialists. However, Elephas had a more flexible foraging ecology and a stronger ability to exploit abrasive grasses than Stegodon. The niche partitioning and perceived different foraging behaviors of Stegodon and Elephas might have reduced the level of interspecific competition and allowed them to coexist during the Pleistocene. Moreover, the high-level of ecological flexibility of Elephas might have helped them to survive until the present day, while Stegodon eventually went extinct by the terminal Pleistocene ∼12 ka. An extensive comparison and evaluation of the δ 13 C data from fossil mammals in mainland southeast Asia during the Early to Late Pleistocene suggests that southern China was dominated by C 3 vegetation throughout the Pleistocene, in contrast with the evidence of C 4 biomes in neighboring Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. Southern China experienced relatively stable environments during the Pleistocene, which can be attributed to the wide range of mountainous regions that acted as ecological refugia from human interference and climatic fluctuations, and allowed the preservation of high biodiversity. The isotopic data we present here provides new evidence about the ecological complexity of mainland southeast Asia and elucidates the need for more systematic research to investigate extinction models and ecological conservation in this region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Coexistence; Elephas; Paleoecology; Paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; Southeast Asia; Stable isotopes; Stegodon,Biodiversity; Isotopes; Mammals; Plants (botany); Tooth enamel; Coexistence; Elephas; Paleo-environment; Paleoecology; Pleistocene; Southeast Asia; Stable isotopes; Stegodon; Ecology; biodiversity; climate effect; coexistence; ecological approach; elephant; extinction; fossil record; interspecific competition; mammal; mountain region; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; preservation; refugium; stable isotope; survival; Cambodia; China; Laos; Thailand; Elephas; Elephas maximus; Mammalia; Poaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063896735,,FALSE,

Although megafossils and macrofossils have been studied since the late eighteenth century, Quaternary botany today is largely dominated by pollen analysis. Quaternary pollen analysis is just over 100 years old. It started primarily as a geological tool for correlation, relative dating, and climate reconstruction. In 1950 a major advance occurred with the publication by Knut Fægri and Johs Iversen of their Text-book of Modern Pollen Analysis which provided the foundations for pollen analysis as a botanical and ecological tool for studying past dynamics of biota and biotic systems. The development of radiocarbon dating in the 1950s freed pollen analysis from being a tool for relative dating. As a result of these developments, pollen analysis became a valuable implement in long-term ecology and biogeography. Selected contributions that Quaternary botany has made to ecology and biogeography since 1950 are reviewed. They fall into four general parts: (1) ecological aspects of interglacial and glacial stages such as location and nature of glacial-stage tree refugia and long-term soil development in glaciated and unglaciated areas; (2) biotic responses to Quaternary environmental change (spreading, extinction, persistence, adaptation); (3) ecological topics such as potential niches, the nature of vegetation, and tree and forest dynamics; and (4) its application to ecological topics such as human impact in tropical systems, conservation in a changing world, island palaeoecology, plant–animal interactions, and biodiversity patterns in time. The future of Quaternary botany is briefly discussed and 10 suggestions are presented to help strengthen it and its links with ecology and biogeography. Quaternary botany has much to contribute to ecology and biogeography when used in conjunction with new approaches such as ancient-DNA, molecular biomarkers, and multi-proxy palaeoecology. © 2019, © 2019 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.",Biodiversity trends; conservation palaeoecology; extinctions; glacial–interglacial cycle; Grubb review; island palaeoecology; macrofossils; pollen analysis; tree and forest dynamics; tree spreading; tropical palynology,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076145064,,FALSE,?

The original material (scales and lepidotrichia) was attributed to Holoptychius (Sarcopterygii, Porolepiformes) according to the ridged ornament on the exposed portion of the scales. Scale and cranial anatomy revealed by the new material supports a reassignment of the species to Langlieria (Sarcopterygii, Tristichopteridae). The emended diagnosis of the new combination includes the grooved scale ornament that was noted, though described differently by Newberry, and a posterior oblique pitline groove of the parietal that extends to the caudal margin of the element. Along with Hyneria lindae and Eusthenodon sp. indet., there are now at least three known species of Tristichopteridae from the Catskill Formation. Temporal/spatial separation of these species, along with supporting anatomical characteristics, suggests that tristichopterids commonly filled the ecological niche of top predator in the Famennian-age nonmarine ecosystems of the Catskill Delta Complex.

One hypothesis suggests that the combination of advantageous traits and long periods of low disturbance is key for this forest's persistence. Here we ask whether there is evidence for the long-term presence of monodominant Gilbertiodendron forest in the absence of fire and climate change. Location: Republic of Congo. Methods: We extracted fossil pollen and macro-charcoal from a sediment sequence collected in present-day monodominant Gilbertiodendron forest stand that spans the last 2,700 years. Climatic changes were inferred using other published palaeoecological records from Central Africa. We also looked at Gilbertiodendron dewevrei's present-day ecological tolerances. Results: Gilbertiodendron pollen was found in every sample covering the last 2,700 years in similar percentages to present-day soil surface samples. In addition, no statistically significant change in pollen composition was found during this time despite vegetation changes being documented in nearby mixed and swamp forest cores over the same time period. No evidence of fire was found for a period of 2,400 years. Only minimal burning occurred over the last 300 years in this monodominant stand. The analysis of ecological tolerances shows G. dewevrei has a broad niche for precipitation (1,300–2,460 mm). Conclusions: Our pollen record is the first to describe the long-term ecological history of an African monodominant forest. Our results show this monodominant stand existed over the past 2,700 years mostly in the absence of fire, providing support for the low disturbance hypothesis as an explanation for monodominance persistence. However, we show that the monodominant forest was continuous, at this site, despite climatic fluctuations in the immediate region. This combined with the broad tolerance of water requirements of the species suggests a potential resilience to future climate variability. However, additional pollen records from a wider area are needed to confirm this. © 2019 International Association for Vegetation Science",Central African rainforest; fossil pollen; Gilbertiodendron monodominant forest; late Holocene; palaeofires; past climate change; resilience; vegetation history,climate change; climate variation; fossil record; Holocene; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; pollen; rainforest; sedimentary sequence; soil surface; swamp forest; tolerance; tropical forest; vegetation history; vegetation type; Central Africa; Gilbertiodendron; Gilbertiodendron dewevrei,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065446065,,FALSE,

This can be studied in the fossil record by investigating the morphospace occupancy of organisms, with small morphospaces signifying low morphological disparity and more diffuse morphospaces suggesting a broader range of morphologies adapted to different environments. Morphological disparity of many taxa (arthropods, crinoids, etc.) from the Cambrian to modern intervals have been studied in this manner. However, no study has investigated this in archaeocyaths, which, as reef builders, can have a disproportionate effect on early Cambrian biodiversity relative to their frequency. Here, we collect morphological data on archaeocyathan sponges, mostly from Laurentia. More than 600 museum specimens and 400 field samples were measured for traditional morphometric characters and discrete gross morphological characteristics. We find that archaeocyaths have an average cup/individual (body) diameter of 10.6 mm. This is significantly smaller than a selected group of modern demosponges and lithistid sponges that measure 94.1 mm and 66.8 mm in diameter, respectively, and each has a larger size variance. Archaeocyathan gross morphologies are also highly constrained to a few simple morphologies (three to six categories), while modern demosponges and lithistids are more diverse (nine categories each). These data indicate that Laurentian archaeocyaths were restricted in their morphological disparity, potentially due to limitations imposed by having a robust calcareous skeleton while still maintaining a large intervallum cavity space to facilitate passive entrainment. The fact that these Cambrian reef builders were restricted in their morphological complexity may have had a strong influence on the biodiversity of early Phanerozoic ecosystems. Furthermore, a clade limited to only a few specific morphologies is at an increased risk of extinction. Copyright © 2019 The Paleontological Society.

Whether ice-age glaciers wiped out all terrestrial plant life or whether some populations persisted in situ remains unclear. We reconstructed the phylogeography of two dominant Patagonian cushion peat bog species, Astelia pumila (G.Forst.) Gaudich. (Asteliaceae) and Donatia fascicularis J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. (Stylidiaceae), to test (a) the hypothesis of a glacial refugium for moorland plants in south-central Chile and (b) the tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. The retrieved phylogeographic patterns were compared with those reported previously for a further cushion peat bog species (Pfanzelt et al., Molecular Ecology 26, 4027–4044), with the objective to provide a broader picture of how West Patagonian moorland plants responded to the Quaternary ice-ages. Location: West and Fuegian Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), southern South America. Methods: DNA sequence data from seven and fourteen, respectively, nuclear loci containing Simple Sequence Repeats of 371 and 328 individuals of the two study species were analysed using population genetic summary statistics, phylogenetic networks and Bayesian and multivariate methods to determine genetic structure. Ecological niche modelling was used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of suitable habitat at the Last Glacial Maximum. Results: All A. pumila populations belong to a single population genetic cluster. In the case of D. fascicularis, only the northernmost sampled population from Nahuelbuta (Chile) is genetically distinct, whereas the remainder forms a cluster without much further substructure. According to palaeodistribution models, south-central Chile offered suitable habitat during the last glacial. Main conclusion: Both ecological niche modelling and the very low genetic subdifferentiation are congruent with a tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. Populations survived the last glacial in south-central Chile, in an area to the northwest of the ice sheet. From there, southern regions were recolonized through highly bottlenecked source populations. Other, non-mutually exclusive factors may have further shaped the population genetic patterns, among them high gene flow mediated by the strong westerly winds. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",ecological niche modelling; Magellanic moorland; microsatellites; next generation sequencing; Patagonia; phylogeography; Quaternary glaciations,DNA; gene flow; genetic analysis; Last Glacial; moorland; niche partitioning; peatland; phylogenetics; phylogeography; population dynamics; refugium; spatial distribution; survival; Chile; Falkland Islands (Malvinas); Patagonia; Astelia pumila; Asteliaceae; Donatia fascicularis; Stylidiaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064049001,,TRUE,

Parmesan, 2006). Some species will benefit from climate change, either directly via the release from climatic niche constraints (. Mohan et al., 2006) or indirectly through their interactions with the abiotic or biotic environment (. Currano et al., 2010; Brodie et al., 2012). Others have shifted their distributions to higher latitudes and elevations to track favorable climatic envelopes (. Perry et al., 2005; Lenoir et al., 2008). Such migrations alleviate the immediate effects of climate change, but species are still likely to encounter novel environmental conditions and species assemblages in their new habitats (. Brown and Vellend, 2014). Species incapable of migrating must tolerate climate change or will have to evolve to avoid extinction (. Burger and Lynch, 1995).Here, we review evolutionary responses to climate change. Climate change is forecast to alter temperature and precipitation regimes while also increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. As such, climate change will likely impose strong novel selection. Species can respond to new abiotic and biotic conditions through: (1) local or global extinctions (Cahill et al., 2013); (2) migration and distributional shifts (Parmesan et al., 1999); (3) plasticity (Nicotra et al., 2010); and (4) adaptation (Thompson et al., 2013). The fossil record reveals that species have persevered through rapid periods of environmental change in the past, both through migration and the evolution of morphological traits (Davis and Shaw, 2001). However, the novel selection pressures imposed by climate change are likely to target physiological and life history traits, which cannot be captured by fossilization. The ecological ramifications of climate change are well-studied in many systems, but the corresponding evolutionary responses have been largely ignored empirically, likely because of methodological challenges (however, see Etterson and Shaw, 2001; Franks et al., 2007, 2016; Jump et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2013; Wilczek et al., 2014).

They have radiated into most niches and fulfil diverse roles in the ecosystem, including wood decomposers, pathogens or mycorrhizal mutualists. Despite the importance of mushroom-forming fungi, large-scale patterns of their evolutionary history are poorly known, in part due to the lack of a comprehensive and dated molecular phylogeny. Here, using multigene and genome-based data, we assemble a 5,284-species phylogenetic tree and infer ages and broad patterns of speciation/extinction and morphological innovation in mushroom-forming fungi. Agaricomycetes started a rapid class-wide radiation in the Jurassic, coinciding with the spread of (sub)tropical coniferous forests and a warming climate. A possible mass extinction, several clade-specific adaptive radiations and morphological diversification of fruiting bodies followed during the Cretaceous and the Paleogene, convergently giving rise to the classic toadstool morphology, with a cap, stalk and gills (pileate-stipitate morphology). This morphology is associated with increased rates of lineage diversification, suggesting it represents a key innovation in the evolution of mushroom-forming fungi. The increase in mushroom diversity started during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic radiation event, an era of humid climate when terrestrial communities dominated by gymnosperms and reptiles were also expanding. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Agaricales; fungal genome; genetic variation; genetics; phylogeny; Agaricales; Genetic Variation; Genome, Fungal; Phylogeny",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063620182,,FALSE,

In order to better understand how mass extinction events can affect clades that survive them, we investigate both the species richness and morphological diversity (disparity) of parareptiles over the course of their history. Furthermore, we examine our observations in the context of other metazoan clades, in order to identify post-extinction survivorship patterns that are present in the clade. The results of our study indicate that there was an early increase in parareptilian disparity, which then fluctuated over the course of the Permian, before it eventually declined sharply towards the end of the Permian and into the Triassic, corresponding with the end-Permian mass extinction event. Interestingly, this is a different trend to what is observed regarding parareptile richness, that shows an almost continuous increase until its overall peak at the end of the Late Permian. Moreover, richness did not experience the same sharp drop at the end of the Permian, reaching a plateau until the Anisian, before dropping sharply and remaining low, with the clade going extinct at the end of the Triassic. This observed pattern is likely to be due to the fact that, despite the extinction of several morphologically distinct parareptile clades, the procolophonoids, one of the largest parareptilian clades, were diversifying across the Permian-Triassic boundary. With the clade's low levels of disparity and eventually declining species richness, this pattern most resembles a 'dead clade walking' pattern.",diversity; Parareptilia; Permian; Reptilia; Sauropsida; Triassic,"animal; biodiversity; classification; evolution; fossil; phylogeny; reptile; species extinction; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Extinction, Biological; Fossils; Phylogeny; Reptiles",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063272799,,FALSE,

To reduce future invasions, it is imperative to determine the naturalization potential of species. Until now, screening approaches have relied largely on species-specific functional feature data. Such information is, however, time-consuming and expensive to collect, thwarting the screening of large numbers of potential invaders. We propose to resolve such data limitations by developing indicators of establishment success of alien species that can be readily derived from open-access databases. These indicators describe key features of successfully established aliens, including estimates of potential range size, niche overlap with human-disturbed environments, and proxies of species traits related to their palaeoinvasions and local dominance capacities. We demonstrate the utility of this new approach by applying it to two large and highly invasive plant groups: Australian acacias and eucalypts. Our results show that these indicators robustly predict establishment successes and failures in each clade independently, and that they can cross-predict establishment in these two clades. Interestingly, the indicator identified as most important was species potential range size on Earth, a variable too rarely considered as a predictor. By successfully identifying key features that predispose Australian plants to naturalize, we provide an objective and cost-effective protocol for flagging high-risk introductions. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Complementary, ancient and modern shells of limpets and mussels were isotopically analysed to explore changes in the isotopic baseline and compare marine food webs through time after an appropriate correction for baseline shifts. Results confirmed a declining pattern of marine primary productivity during the Late Holocene in the Beagle Channel. In general, the isotopic niches overlapped largely in the ancient food web in comparison to the current marine one, with the exception of that of cormorants (Phalacrocorax sp.). Our data suggest that all the species that have undergone intense human exploitation (Arctocephalus australis, Otaria flavescens and Merluccius sp.) significantly increased their trophic levels. The most important finding of this work was the very high isotopic overlap between snoek (Thyrsites atun) and hake (Merluccius sp.) during the Late Holocene. Increasing SST as a result of global warming could favour the recolonization of the southern South-Western Atlantic Ocean by snoek from the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a potential impact on the landings of the economically important Argentine and Austral hake.

The northern part of the range of both species was genetically homogeneous, which is probably due to its recent colonization from one of the glacial refugia. This conclusion is in agreement with published pollen and macrofossil data in Siberian fir and with the reconstruction of environmental niches indicating a dramatic reduction of the range and a likely survival of fir in certain southern areas during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), 21 thousand years ago.

During the last 30 years research on Manawa documented the basal position of the superfamily Puncioidea within the phylogenetic tree of the Subclass Podocopa. The Palaeocopa is possibly a heterogenous taxon containing both myodocopids and podocopids. Re-examination of the systematic position, phylogenetic affinities and evolution of the superfamily Puncioidea is presented using information from the comparative analysis of the body plans of Myodocopa and Podocopa, rationalised within morpho-functional modules: the carapace as a‘protective’ construct, the ambulatory complex, combined with feeding, reproductive and sensory systems. The significant traits of the different morpho-functional modules of the superfamily Puncioidea when compared to those of the ostracod Orders Podocopida and Platycopida suggest for the former group an independent phylogenetic position within the Subclass Podocopa, taxonomically treated as Order Punciocopida Schallreuter, 1968. Morphological traits such as the maxillulary endopodite and the 8th body limb of M. staceyi are considered deep genetic homologies existing within the Subclass Podocopa at the level of cellular regulatory systems. The widely gaping valves held in a ‘horizontal’ plane during the ambulatory activity and the collaborative structure and position of the 2nd antenna continued with respect to the 5th to 7th pair of limbs are considered solutions (adaptations) to psammobiotic life within the dynamic shallow marine habitats. Examination of the discrepancy between the low species diversity of Puncioidea and those of the species-rich non-marine Cypridoidea may be as a result of the major differences in the way representatives of the two ostracod groups are able to actively perceive the surrounding environment as well as to their capacity to construct their niche, leading to successful speciation. © 2019, National Research and Development Institute for Marine Geology and Geoecology.

Within these relict deposits, ancient microbial mats, or paleomats, have been preserved under extremely arid and cold conditions since the receding of larger paleolakes thousands of years ago, and now serve as a sheltered niche for microbes in a highly challenging oligotrophic environment. To explore whether paleomats could be repositories for ancient lake cells or were later colonized by soil microbes, determine what types of metabolic pathways might be present, analyze potential gene expression, and explore whether the cells are in a vegetative or dormant state, we collected paleomat samples from ancient lake facies on the northern slopes of Lake Vanda in Wright Valley in December 2016. Using a gentle lysis technique optimized to preserve longer molecules, combined with a polyenzymatic treatment to maximize yields from different cell types, we isolated high-molecular weight DNA and RNA from ancient paleomat samples. Community composition analysis suggests that the paleomat community may retain a population of indigenous mat cells that may flourish once more favorable conditions are met. In addition to harboring a diverse microbial community, paleomats appear to host heterotrophs in surrounding soils utilizing the deposits as a carbon source. Whole genome long-read PacBio sequencing of native DNA and Illumina metagenomic sequencing of size-sorted DNA (> 2,500 nt) indicated possible cell viability, with mat community composed of bacterial taxa. Metagenome assemblies identified genes with predicted roles in nitrogen cycling and complex carbohydrate degradation, and we identified key metabolic pathways such as stress response, DNA repair, and sporulation.

These sites have yielded a vast collection of large fossil mammals with a well-documented presence of fossil equids in both localities (represented mostly by isolated teeth). Coste San Giacomo is dated to around 2.1 Ma, thereby having recorded the effects of the onset of the Quaternary glacial cycles, which led to a gradual trend toward colder and more arid conditions in the Northern Hemisphere. The fossil equids of this site belong to the first group of grazing stenonid equids of the genus Equus that spread to the Italian Peninsula during the so called ""Elephant- Equus"" event, which marked the appearance of new large mammals living in herds in open and arid environments. The site of Fontana Ranuccio is dated to around 400 ka, close to the MIS 12-11 succession (the ""Mid-Brunhes event""), which marked the end of the Middle Pleistocene Transition. The fossil horses from Fontana Ranuccio represent one of the oldest caballoid (or ""true horses"") populations of the Italian Peninsula. The Anagni Basin, thus, provides important data to investigate paleoecological adaptations of these groups of equids in response to two critical environmental and climatic shifts of the Pleistocene. We explore their niche occupation by examining long-term dental wear patterns and tooth enamel carbon and oxygen stable isotopic composition. Both taxa appear to have exhibited a narrow dietary niche, displaying a clear abrasive (highly specialized) grass-rich diet.

To investigate the population history and demography of an endemic oak species (Quercus aquigolioides, Fagaceae) from the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains region, and elucidate how the unique climatic conditions and heterogeneous topography resulted the uplift of the QTP shaped the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the species.We sequenced and analyzed a total 1406 base pairs from chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) trnT-L sequences for 296 individuals from 19 populations across the species’ geographic range. Based on these data, we constructed the genealogical relationships and coalescent analysis was used to test demographic hypotheses. 38 haplotypes were identified based on cpDNA variation, and of overall 38 haplotypes, 33 hyplotypes are restricted to single population. High levels of haplotype diversity (Hd=0.948) and low levels of nucleotide diversity (π=0.1976) were detected within the whole species, and a great amount of variation occurred among populations within groups (57.3%). The phylogenetic result demonstrated that Q. aquifolioides cpDNA hyplotypes have three main genetic lineages with distinct distribution. And these genetic lineages resulted by two main bottlenecks in the species took place at 9.37Ma and 8.41Ma, and they have undergone several genetic bottlenecks for a time span of ca. 9 million years. Significant inter population differentiation and phylogeopgraphic structure were also detected (G ST =0.629, N ST = 0.946, N ST &gt;G ST , P&lt;0.01), and the mismatch distribution analyses indicated a demographic equilibrium for Q. aquifolioides. But as a result of its complex topography, the overall network gave no clear indication regarding demographic process. Together with fossil evidence, the results strongly suggested that multiple microrefugia of Q. aquifolioides existing and the microrefugia were scattered throughout the present geographical range before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Although this species seems to have post-glacial expansion, Q. aquifolioides did not undergo marked changes in population sizes from the late Miocene. And the uplift of the QTP contributed to the phylogeny of cpDNA hyplotypes and differentiation among the population by heterogeneous topographies and climatic change formed the uplift. The two main genetic bottlenecks at ca. 9Ma could contribute to the uplift of eastern and southern QTP at 13-8Ma and strengthen of Asian Summer monsoon at same time causing by the uplift. And several genetic differentiations at ca. 3Ma could confirm with the uplift of the QTP since 3.6Ma. It was reasonable to conclude that the Mio-Pliocene growth of the QTP and the accompanied climatic changes could account for the modern pattern of Q. aquifolioides phylogenetic structure in the HHMs region: first, the center and northern QTP drought and the different evaluation in south and east margin at 13-8Ma made the three main different lineages (NW group and other all). Then the asynchronous and heterogeneous uplifting of QTP in different regions during 9-0.7 Ma resulted to the difference time of the bottleneck in the different lineages. These findings have wide implications for understanding plant species’ responses to the uplift of QTP and climatic change with it. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.",Demographic history; Divergence; Ecological niches; Microrefugia; Molecular phylogeography; Nucleotide variation; Oak; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP),alpine environment; chloroplast; climate conditions; demography; divergence; ecological approach; endemic species; evergreen tree; evolutionary biology; genetic differentiation; genetic variation; geographical region; identification method; Last Glacial Maximum; molecular analysis; molecular ecology; niche; phylogenetics; phylogeny; phylogeography; Pliocene; Postglacial; range expansion; summer; China; Hengduan Mountains; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Fagaceae; Quercus; Quercus aquifolioides,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063645196,,FALSE,

Extensive efforts are underway to detect signals of biotic interactions in macroecological data. However, efforts are limited by bias in the taxa and spatial scale for which occurrence data are available and by difficulty in ascribing causality to co-occurrence patterns. Moreover, we are not necessarily looking in the right places; analyses are largely ad hoc, depending on availability of data, rather than focusing on regions, taxa, ecosystems or interaction types where biotic interactions might affect species’ geographical ranges most strongly. Unpicking biotic interactions: We suggest that macroecology would benefit from the recognition that abiotic conditions alter two key components of biotic interaction strength: frequency and intensity. We outline how and why variation in biotic interaction strength occurs, explore the implications for species’ geographical ranges and discuss the challenges inherent in quantifying these effects. In addition, we explore the role of behavioural flexibility in mediating biotic interactions potentially to mitigate impacts of environmental change. New data: We argue that macroecology should take advantage of “independent” data on the strength of biotic interactions measured by other disciplines, in order to capture a far wider array of taxa, locations and interaction types than are typically studied in macroecology. Data on biotic interactions are readily available from community, disease, microbial and parasite ecology, evolution, palaeontology, invasion biology and agriculture, but most are yet to be exploited within macroecology. Integrating biotic interaction strength data into macroecology: Harmonization of data across interdisciplinary sources, taxa and interaction types could be achieved by breaking down interactions into elements that contribute to frequency and intensity. This would allow quantitative biotic interaction data to be incorporated directly into models of species distributions and macroecological patterns. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate envelope model; competition; encounter rate; facilitation; latitudinal biodiversity gradient; mutualism; niche; species distribution model; stress gradient hypothesis; trophic interaction,biodiversity; climate effect; competition (ecology); geographical variation; interdisciplinary approach; latitudinal gradient; macroecology; mutualism; niche; trophic interaction,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059280962,,FALSE,*

Beyond the basic expectation of greater environmental filtering in currently stressful contexts, we addressed how biogeographic history and past climates contributed to shaping the distribution and diversity of extant taxa. Location: Evergreen forests of Western Ghats, India. Methods: We evaluated the relative importance of niche-based, historical, and spatial processes on community phylogenetic structure and turnover in 297 plots including 459 species. If niche conservatism prevails, we expected greater phylogenetic clustering under harsher or historically less stable climates, and overdispersion in opposite conditions. To test the role of environmental filtering in shaping local communities, we assessed species’ climatic niches and congruence between niche and phylogenetic diversity. To assess the imprint of ancient versus recent evolutionary constraints, we calculated mean pair-wise (MPD) and nearest-taxon (MNTD) phylogenetic distances, respectively. Results: We found non-random phylogenetic structure depending on both current and past climatic variation. Basal community phylogenetic structure (MPD) was related to niche diversity and varied according to hydric stress: (a) northern environments filtered more closely related species, while (b) phylogenetic overdispersion suggested greater niche differentiation in stable, least-seasonal southern habitats and at high elevations. Terminal phylogenetic structure (MNTD) did not show overdispersion. Phylogenetic turnover was driven by current abiotic factors, not space. Main conclusions: The patterns of ecological and phylogenetic diversity likely reflect the Miocene climate shift to increasing seasonality northwards. Phylogenetic clustering under hydric stress or historical instability suggests the influence of functional conservatism, whereas overdispersion in southern forests supports the persistence of old lineages in an ancient rain forest refugium as an evolutionary museum. Overdispersion in fragmented montane forests reflects a mixture of biogeographically distinct species pools, both tropical and temperate, that characterise environmentally contrasted cores and fringes.

The rhinoceros Elasmotherium sibiricum, known as the ‘Siberian unicorn’, was believed to have gone extinct around 200,000 years ago—well before the late Quaternary megafaunal extinction event. However, no absolute dating, genetic analysis or quantitative ecological assessment of this species has been undertaken. Here, we show, by accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating of 23 individuals, including cross-validation by compound-specific analysis, that E. sibiricum survived in Eastern Europe and Central Asia until at least 39,000 years ago, corroborating a wave of megafaunal turnover before the Last Glacial Maximum in Eurasia, in addition to the better-known late-glacial event. Stable isotope data indicate a dry steppe niche for E. sibiricum and, together with morphology, a highly specialized diet that probably contributed to its extinction. We further demonstrate, with DNA sequencing data, a very deep phylogenetic split between the subfamilies Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae that includes all the living rhinoceroses, settling a debate based on fossil evidence and confirming that the two lineages had diverged by the Eocene. As the last surviving member of the Elasmotheriinae, the demise of the ‘Siberian unicorn’ marked the extinction of this subfamily. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon; DNA; nitrogen; animal; bone; chemistry; genetics; molecular evolution; Perissodactyla; phylogeny; species extinction; Animals; Bone and Bones; Carbon Isotopes; DNA; Evolution, Molecular; Extinction, Biological; Nitrogen Isotopes; Perissodactyla; Phylogeny",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057320195,,FALSE,

Analyses of lineage diversification show time-heterogeneous rates of lineage diversification in carangarians, with highest rates reached during the Palaeocene. Likewise, a remarkable proportion of Carangaria's morphological variation originated early in the history of the group and in tandem with a marked incidence of habitat shifts. Taken together, these results suggest that all major lineages and body plans in Carangaria originated in an early burst shortly after the K-Pg mass extinction, which ultimately allowed the occupation of newly released niches along the benthic-pelagic habitat axis. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Historical hybridization during range replacements led to high frequencies of mtDNA introgression from Lepus timidus into populations of three other species in northern Iberian Peninsula, even though L. timidus subsequently disappeared from the region. We use palaeontological records to provide new insights on the biogeographic history of these range replacements, combining ancient DNA and ecological niche modelling. Location: Southern France. Taxon: Hares (genus Lepus). Methods: DNA was extracted from hare bones collected at Neolithic sites in southern France (5.5–7.5 thousand years before present; kyr bp) with uncertain species assignment. One mtDNA fragment was sequenced and 27 SNPs from 11 nuclear genes with species-diagnostic information were genotyped. Distributions of L. granatensis, L. europaeus, and L. timidus were modelled using spatial and bioclimatic predictors, and the favourability function. Each model was transferred to 6 kyr bp and favourabilities were combined to determine the species with the highest environmental favourability in each sampled locality. Results: Ancient DNA analysis showed that the screened specimens belong to L. granatensis, a species presently confined to the Iberian Peninsula, but carried mtDNA haplotypes from L. timidus. Niche models show that L. granatensis achieved highest favourability in southern France 6 kyr bp reinforcing the molecular evidences. Main conclusions: L. granatensis replaced L. timidus populations from Iberia to southern France, being present in this region 5.5 kyr bp. Subsequent westwards invasion of L. europaeus likely replaced these L. granatensis populations towards northern Iberia, establishing current ranges. Despite successive species replacements, introgressed mtDNA haplotypes from L. timidus mark the distribution of the species in northern Iberian Peninsula before it disappeared in the region.

Modern Nautilus is sometimes used as a model organism for understanding ammonites, but despite their outward similarities, the groups are only distantly related. Trends in ammonite diversity and extinction vulnerability in the fossil record contrast starkly with those of nautilids, and embryonic shells from Late Cretaceous ammonites are two orders of magnitude smaller than nautilid embryonic shells. To investigate possible environmental changes experienced by ammonite hatchlings, we used secondary ion mass spectrometry to analyze the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of the embryonic shells and early postembryonic whorls of five juveniles of Hoploscaphites comprimus obtained from a single concretion in the Fox Hills Formation of South Dakota. Co-occurring bivalves and diagenetic calcite were also analyzed to provide a benthic baseline for comparison. The oxygen isotope ratios of embryonic shells are more like those of benthic bivalves, suggesting that ammonite eggs were laid on the bottom. Ammonite shell immediately after hatching has more negative δ18O, suggesting movement to more shallow water that is potentially warmer and/or fresher. After approximately one whorl of postembryonic growth, the values of δ18O become more positive in three of the five individuals, suggesting that these animals transitioned to a more demersal mode of life. Two other individuals transition to even lower δ18O values that could suggest movement to nearshore brackish water. These data suggest that ammonites, like many modern coleoids, may have spawned at different times of the year. Because scaphites were one of the short-term Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction survivors, it is possible that this characteristic allowed them to develop a broader geographic range and, consequently, a greater resistance to extinction. © 2018 The Paleontological Society.

From evidence of mass extinctions, we know that rapid climatic oscillations can indirectly open niche space and precipitate adaptive radiation, changing the course of ecological diversification. These dramatic shifts in the global climate, however, are rare events relative to extended periods of protracted climate change and biome turnover. It remains unclear whether during gradually changing periods, shifting habitats may instead promote non-adaptive speciation by facilitating allopatry and phenotypic conservatism. Using fossil-calibrated, species-level phylogenies for five Australian radiations comprising more than 800 species, we investigated temporal trends in biogeography and body size evolution. Here, we demonstrate that gradual Miocene cooling and aridification correlates with the restricted phenotypic diversification of multiple ecologically diverse vertebrate groups. This probably occurred as species ranges became fractured and isolated during continental biome restructuring, encouraging a shift towards conservatism in body size evolution.

Spatial sampling bias is a known issue when modeling extant species. Here we quantify the spatial sampling bias in a North American packrat midden archive and explore its impact on estimating paleo-distributions. We test whether (1) spatial sampling bias inherent in this macrofossil record can influence estimates of paleo-distributions, (2) this bias can alter the ability to measure shifts in distributions and climatic niche breadth from the Northgrippian subdivision of the Holocene (8.3 ka – 4.2 ka) to present day (1950–2000 yr), and (3) bias correction methods can improve estimates of paleo-distributions and analyses of range shifts and niche breadth. We estimate spatial sampling bias for the mid-Holocene period with a three-stage statistical model, each representing a hypothesized source of bias: fossil site availability, preservation and accessibility. This approach enables the use of SDM to evaluate three separate paleo-distributions calibrated on the packrat midden archive: those without bias correction (σ-naïve), those created with a standard method (σ-standard), and those created with a novel alternative (σ-modeled) incorporating the three-stage model of bias. We find that paleo-distributions modeled for the mid-Holocene without bias correction (σ-naïve) provided poor estimates of hindcast paleo-distributions, and that the σ-modeled correction method improved paleo-distributions for our six species with, on average, 50% higher overlap to hindcast distributions than σ-naïve paleo-distributions (σ-standard results fell between σ-naïve and σ-modeled). © 2018",Data analysis; Data treatment; Holocene; Macrofossils; Neotoma; Niche breadth; North America; Paleogeography; Spatial sampling bias; Species distribution modeling,Biological materials preservation; Data reduction; Population distribution; Sampling; Data treatment; Holocenes; Macrofossils; Neotoma; Niche breadth; North America; Paleogeography; Spatial sampling; Species distribution modeling; Spatial distribution; data acquisition; ecological modeling; ecological modernization; fossil record; hindcasting; Holocene; niche breadth; paleobiogeography; paleogeography; sampling bias; Neotoma,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054147673,,TRUE,*

A ‘simple’ model assumes that most, if not all, Ediacaran organisms shared similar basic ecologies. A contrasting ‘complex’ model suggests that the Ediacara biota more likely represent organisms from a variety of different positions on the eukaryotic tree and thus occupied a wide range of different ecologies. We perform a quantitative test of Ediacaran ecosystem complexity using rank abundance distributions (RADs). We show that the Ediacara biota formed complex-type communities throughout much of their stratigraphic range and thus likely comprised species that competed for different resources and/or created niche for others (‘ecosystem engineers’). One possible explanation for this pattern rests in the recent inference of multiple metazoan-style feeding modes among the Ediacara biota; in this scenario, different Ediacaran groups/clades were engaged in different methods of nutrient collection and thus competed for different resources. This result illustrates that the Ediacara biota may not have been as bizarre as it is sometimes suggested, and provides an ecological link with the animal-dominated benthic ecosystems of the Palaeozoic era. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"biological model; biota; ecosystem; evolution; fossil; paleontology; Biological Evolution; Biota; Ecosystem; Fossils; Models, Biological; Paleontology",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053677589,,FALSE,

Norse Scandinavian farmers introduced agriculture to sub-arctic Greenland in the late tenth century, creating synanthropic landscapes and utilising seasonally abundant marine and terrestrial resources. Using a niche-construction framework and data from recent survey work, studies of diet, and regional-scale climate proxies we examine the potential mismatch between this imported agricultural niche and the constraints of the environment from the tenth to the fifteenth centuries.

Many groups of these reptiles coexisted for over 50 million years (Myr), through major environmental changes. However, little is known about how the structure of their ecosystems or their ecologies changed over millions of years. We use the most common marine reptile fossils—teeth—to establish a quantitative system that assigns species to dietary guilds and then track the evolution of these guilds over the roughly 18-million-year history of a single seaway, the Jurassic Sub-Boreal Seaway of the United Kingdom. Groups did not significantly overlap in guild space, indicating that dietary niche partitioning enabled many species to live together. Although a highly diverse fauna was present throughout the history of the seaway, fish and squid eaters with piercing teeth declined over time while hard-object and large-prey specialists diversified, in concert with rising sea levels. High niche partitioning and spatial variation in dietary ecology related to sea depth also characterize modern marine tetrapod faunas, indicating a conserved ecological structure of the world’s oceans that has persisted for over 150 Myr. © 2018, The Author(s).",,animal; aquatic species; classification; diet; ecosystem; evolution; life history trait; physiology; reptile; sea; United Kingdom; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biological Evolution; Diet; Ecosystem; Life History Traits; Oceans and Seas; Reptiles; United Kingdom,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053359073,,FALSE,

Here, we have gathered, reanalyzed and compared previously published or unpublished morphometric and genetic data that have not yet been integrated and that we synthesize in a unified framework. In particular, we re-estimate dates of divergence of mitogenome lineages based on an extended dataset comprising 81 complete ancient bison mitogenomes and we revisit putative gene flow between the Bos and Bison genera based on comparative analyses of ancient and modern bison genomes, thereby questioning published conclusions. Morphometric analyses taking into account sexual dimorphism invalidate a previous claim that Bison schoetensacki was present in France during the Late Pleistocene. Both morphometric and genome analyses reveal that Eurasian bison belonging to different Bison priscus and Bison bonasus lineages maintained parallel evolutionary paths with gene flow during a long period of incomplete speciation that ceased only upon the migration of B. priscus to the American continent establishing the American bison lineage. Our nuclear genome analysis of the evolutionary history of B. bonasus allows us to reject the previous hypothesis that it is a hybrid of B. priscus and Bos primigenius. Based on present-day behavioral studies of European and American bison, we propose that apparently conflicting lines of evidence can be reconciled by positing that female bison drove the specialization of bison populations to different ecological niches while male bison drove regular homogenizing genetic exchanges between populations. © 2018 by the authors.",Bison; Bos; Climate change; Evolution; Genome; Holocene; Morphology; Paleogenomics; Pleistocene; Sexual dimorphism,climate variation; evolutionary biology; genome; Holocene; morphology; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; population dynamics; population genetics; sexual dimorphism; ungulate; Bison; Bison antiquus; Bison bison; Bison bonasus; Bison priscus; Bos primigenius,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053768817,,FALSE,

The leading hypotheses of euprimate origins promulgate diet as a core component of the early evolution of this group, despite the role of dietary competition in euprimate originations never being tested directly. This study compared three competition models (non-competition, competitive displacement, competitive coexistence) with observed patterns of dietary niche overlap, reconstructed from three-dimensional molar morphology, at the time of the euprimate radiation in North America (at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary). Overlap of reconstructed multidimensional dietary niches between euprimates and members of their guild were analysed using a modified MANOVA to establish the nature of the competitive environment surrounding euprimate origins in North America (an immigration event). Results indicated that adapids entered the mammalian guild in the absence of competition, suggesting dietary adaptations that were unique within the community. Conversely, omomyids experienced strong, but transitory, competition with nyctitheriids, suggesting that omomyids possessed the ability to out-compete this group. These results show that adapids and omomyids experienced different competitive scenarios upon their arrival (origination) in North America and confirm the significance of diet (and dietary adaptations) in euprimate origination and early diversification in mammalian communities. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Detailed bed-by-bed ichnologic studies were performed at a high-resolution scale from two uppermost Permian sections (Shangsi and Dongpan) in South China, documenting the presence of Chondrites targionii, Chondrites isp., Nereites isp., Planolites isp. A, Planolites isp. B, Palaeophycus isp., Phycosiphon incertum, Thalassinoides isp., and Zoophycos isp. The uppermost Permian strata at the Shangsi section mainly comprise siliceous limestone interbedded with illite-montmorillonite claystone and shale, recording a deep shelf setting. The uppermost Permian strata at the Dongpan section consist of mixed chert, mudstone and claystone, formed in a slope environment. Bioturbation index in uppermost Permian strata is mostly 1–2, but with thin intervals reaching 3–4. Fluctuating bioturbation intensities, ichnofaunal composition (Thalassinoides, Planolites, Zoophycos) and ethologies, as well as the ratio of highly reactive iron to total iron (FeHr/FeT) and the proportion of the highly reactive iron pool in the form of pyrite (Fepy/FeHR) suggest that bottom and interstitial oxygen levels were not permanently anoxic/euxinic, but were interrupted by brief periods of aerobic conditions during the latest Permian. Three bioturbation phases in the EPME are identified. Phase I is characterized by the absence of typical pascichnia ichnotaxa (e.g. Nereites isp.) and relatively large fodinichnia burrow (e.g., Planolites isp. B; Zoophycos isp.). Phase II mainly consists of smaller Planolites isp. A, Thalassinoides isp. and Chondrites isp., recording a transition from softground to firmground. Only occasional smaller Planolites isp. A occur in Phase III without any associated vertical burrows. Ichnodiversity and bioturbation index from Phase I to Phase III show a step by step decline, corresponding to the two-stage extinction patterns. Long-term environmental stress (e.g., oceanic anoxia, volcanic winter, global warming, ocean acidification, hypercapnia) may have played major role in the collapse of the infaunal ecospace and only facies-crossing, highly tolerant, opportunistic organisms may have persisted in otherwise vacant ecological niches in the aftermath of the extinction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Anoxia; Bioturbation index; Dongpan; End-Permian mass extinction; Ichnology; Meishan; Shangsi,Biology; Global warming; Iron; Lime; Meteorites; Oxygen; Pyrites; Anoxia; Bioturbation; Dongpan; Ichnology; Mass extinction; Meishan; Shangsi; Stratigraphy; Nereites; Palaeophycus; Planolites; Thalassinoides; Zoophycos,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048483830,,FALSE,

Khok Sung in Northeastern Thailand is a late Middle Pleistocene terrace deposit, tentatively dated either as 213 ka or 188 ka, yielding 15 described mammalian taxa with especially abundant and complete fossil remains. To investigate paleodiets and habitats of these ancient mammals and to understand the corresponding regional climate, we performed an analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes extracted from tooth enamel carbonate of various mammalian taxa, coupled with the cenogram method. The enamel δ13C values of Khok Sung mammals indicate a variety of diets, ranging from pure C3 to C4 plants, suggesting that C4 grasses were a major component of local Thai ecosystems during the late Middle Pleistocene. The stable isotopic distinction between C3 and C4 plants suggests that the Pleistocene wildlife habitats ranged from closed forests to open grasslands for the Khok Sung area. Moreover, differences within sympatric Pleistocene herbivores such as proboscideans, rhinoceroses, and cervids characterize possible niche partitioning by minimizing interspecific overlap. Paleoclimatic interpretations based on the intra-tooth variability in enamel δ18O values from large mammals and on the cenogram analysis reflect significant seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature, and humid conditions, for the Khok Sung locality.

This study provides the first testate amoebae modern training set (n = 72) from forested peatlands of the James Bay lowlands, eastern Canada. The relationships between testate amoeba communities and environmental variables (pH, water table depth, canopy openness, mineral particles concentration) were investigated using canonical correspondence analyses. Our data have shown that testate amoebae are sensitive environmental indicators in forested peatlands and can be used to reconstruct past hydrological conditions for these environments. A transfer function for water table depth (WTD) reconstructions was developed using weighted averaging models and was tested on a fossil testate amoebae record. In comparing forested and non-forested peatlands datasets we have shown that testate amoebae occupy similar ecological niches with respect to surface wetness in both ecosystems, but that their WTD optima is much higher (drier) in forested peatlands. The results show that the diversity and composition of testate amoeba assemblages do not vary significantly at the microform scale.

Despite their potency in view of consumer-owned distributed generation and enhanced citizen influence in the organization of the energy infrastructure, local low-carbon energy initiatives (LLCEIs) struggle to become viable alternatives to the centralized, private oriented energy system. To further LLCEI development, support needs to build their capacities; alleviate institutional hurdles and barriers stemming from the fossil fuel-based energy regime; and open up the system for the uptake, acceptance or breakthrough of LLCEIs. Evidence suggests that so-called ""intermediaries"" form a part of the solution in addressing these issues.

Based on the climatic or geographic filtering hypotheses associated with tropical niche conservatism and dispersal limitation, we analysed phylogenetic community structures across a wide range of biomes and evaluated to what extent region-specific processes have influenced large-scale diversity patterns of tree species communities across latitude or continent. Location: Global. Methods: We generated a data set of species abundances for 21,379 angiosperm woody plants in 843 plots worldwide. We calculated net relatedness index (NRI) for each plot, based on a single global species pool and regional species pools, and phylogenetic β-diversity (PBD) between plots. Then, we explored the correlations of NRI with climatic and geographic variables, and clarified phylogenetic dissimilarity along geographic and climatic differences. We also compared these patterns for South America, Africa, the Indo-Pacific, Australia, the Nearctic, Western Palearctic and Eastern Palearctic. Results: NRI based on a global-scale species pool was negatively associated with precipitation and positively associated with Quaternary temperature change. PBD was positively associated with geographic distance and precipitation difference between plots across tropical and extratropical biomes. Moreover, phylogenetic dissimilarity was smaller in extratropical regions than in regions including the tropics, although temperate forests of the Eastern Palearctic showed a greater dissimilarity within extratropical regions. Conclusions: Our findings support predictions of the climatic and geographic filtering hypotheses. Climatic filtering (climatic harshness and paleoclimatic change) relative to tropical niche conservatism played a role in sorting species from the global species pool and shaped the large-scale diversity patterns, such as the latitudinal gradient observed across continents. Geographic filtering associated with dispersal limitation substantially contributed to regional divergence of tropical/extratropical biomes among continents. Old, long-standing geographic barriers and recent climatic events differently influenced evolutionary diversification of angiosperm tree communities in tropical and extratropical biomes. © 2018 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to infer diversification processes and mechanisms of Cenozoic diversity dynamics using woody angiosperms. Location: East Asian continental islands and global. Time period: Cenozoic. Major taxa studied: Woody plants. Methods: We compiled Cenozoic fossil and modern records for woody angiosperm genera to reconstruct biodiversity patterns. To evaluate the relative importance of TNC and OTT, we investigated extinction/survival patterns and latitudinal range dynamics for each genus, in combination with their clade age (mean family age), cold tolerance and per-genus species richness. Results: We found diversity decreasing with latitude in modern-day flora, but not in the warmer periods of the Neogene and Palaeogene. The percentage of genera surviving decreased with latitude through the Cenozoic. Older genera with less cold tolerance and/or species-poor genera went extinct locally at high latitudes in response to post-Pliocene global cooling. Evolutionarily younger temperate genera dispersed from the extratropics to lower latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere after the Neogene. Main conclusions: The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) has rapidly steepened post-Pliocene through: (a) selective extinction in higher latitudes of old, less-diversified tropical genera with low freezing tolerance, and (b) equatorward distributional shift of temperate genera. Both these processes were driven by the high-latitude cooling.

Ecospace modelling has historically been restricted to a combination of visual interpretation and quantification via metrics such as mean sum of ranges. We argue that comparing ecosystem function in this way overlooks critical information about degrees of overlap and redundancy, and potentially misrepresents the role of “empty ecospace” in driving macroevolution. Fuzzy ecospace modelling (FEM) places conventional ecospace modelling within a fuzzy set-theoretic framework, wherein functional groups are learned from the dataset, creating models which are sensitive to overlap and the role of empty ecospace. Fuzzy ecospace modelling is a machine learning program which quantifies functional ecological similarity, and uses this information to classify new taxa. It creates functional groups using a Gower dissimilarity coefficient-based approach to the k-medoids algorithm, and uses fuzzy discriminant analysis to classify the taxa present in another ecosystem into these clusters, based on minimal Gower dissimilarity with a fuzzy threshold. This has the effect of quantifying the similarity between these ecosystems in terms of their functional groups, accounting for total redundancy, partial redundancy/novelty and total novelty. By using fuzzy membership functions, FEM can classify taxa which are highly ecologically dissimilar (outliers with respect to all functional groups), taxa which are fully redundant (100% similarity to those in a given functional group) and taxa in-between, which represent degrees of niche overlap. This can be used to compare the functional groups present in different ecosystems (as well as their degrees of overlap), and as a metric approach to comparing total ecological disparity. These results can be used to test models of the role of empty ecospace in macroevolutionary trends, or to investigate how ecosystems respond to global perturbations. Furthermore, it allows us to define numerically the concept of empty ecospace for n-dimensional datasets. A cluster-based approach to the quantification of ecospace allows for a numerical estimate of niche overlap, a value particularly difficult to quantify in fossil contexts. © 2018 The Authors.

Some dietary proxies exploit the fact that mammalian teeth experience wear during mastication, due to both tooth-on-tooth and food-on-tooth interactions. The distribution and types of wear detectible at micro- and macroscales are highly correlated with the resource preferences of individuals and, in turn, species. Because methods that quantify the distribution of tooth wear (i.e., analytical tooth wear methods) do so by direct observation of facets and marks on the teeth of individual animals, dietary inferences derived from them are thought to be independent of the clade to which individuals belong. However, an assumption of clade or phylogenetic independence when making species-level dietary inferences may be misleading if phylogenetic niche conservatism is widespread among mammals. Herein, we test for phylogenetic signal in data from numerous analytical tooth wear studies, incorporating macrowear (i.e., mesowear) and microwear (i.e., low-magnification microwear and dental microwear texture analysis). Using two measures of phylogenetic signal, heritability (H2) and Pagel's λ, we find that analytical tooth wear data are not independent of phylogeny and failing to account for such nonindependence leads to overestimation of discriminability among species with different dietary preferences. We suggest that morphological traits inherited from ancestral clades (e.g., tooth shape) influence the ways in which the teeth wear during mastication and constrain the foods individuals of a species can effectively exploit. We do not suggest that tooth wear is simply phylogeny in disguise; the tooth wear of individuals and species likely varies within some range that is set by morphological constraints. We therefore recommend the use of phylogenetic comparative methods in studies of mammalian tooth wear, whenever possible. © 2018 The Authors.

The roseobacter Phaeobacter inhibens exploits both symbiotic and pathogenic niches while interacting with its microalgal host Emiliania huxleyi. During co-cultivation over extended periods with E. huxleyi, we show that P. inhibens selectively kills two host cell types, the diploid calcifying strain and the haploid flagellated strain. Meanwhile, various non-calcifying diploid strains are resistant to this pathogen or the pathogen is avirulent to this cell type. This differential pathogenesis has the potential of dramatically altering the composition of E. huxleyi blooms, which are typically dominated by the roseobacter-susceptible calcifying strain. This cell type makes calcite plates, which are an important sink in the marine carbon cycle and forms part of the marine paleobotanic record. P. inhibens kills the haploid cells, which have been proposed as critical to the survival of the algae, as they readily escape both eukaryotic predation and viral infection.

This priority effect occurs when the lineage that arrives first expands its niche breadth and diversifies into a set of ecological specialists with associated monopolization of the resources. Later-arriving species do not experience ecological opportunity and do not radiate. While theoretical support and evidence from microbial experiments for priority effects are strong, empirical evidence in nature is difficult to obtain. Lake Victoria (LV) is home to an exceptional adaptive radiation of haplochromine cichlid fishes, where 20 trophic guilds and several hundred species emerged in just 15 000 years, the age of the modern lake that was preceded by a complete desiccation lasting several thousand years. However, while about 50 other lineages of teleost fish also have established populations in the lake, none of them has produced more than two species and most of them did not speciate at all. Here, we test if the ancestors of the haplochromine radiation indeed arrived prior to the most competent potential competitors, ‘tilapias’ and cyprinids, both of which have made rapid radiations in other African lakes. We assess LV sediment core intervals from just before the desiccation and just after refilling for the presence of fossil fish teeth. We show that all three lineages were present when modern LV began to fill with water. We conclude that the haplochromines’ extraordinary radiation unfolded in the presence of potentially competing lineages and cannot be attributed to a simple priority effect. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We tested this idea using the Neogene fossil record of chondrichthyans along the temperate Pacific coast of South America (TPSA). Information for georeferenced occurrences and ecological and life-history information of 38 chondrichthyan fossil genera in 42 Neogene sites was collected. Global georeferenced records were used to estimate present-day biogeographic distributions of the genera and to characterize the range of oceanographic conditions in which each genus lives as a proxy of their realized niche. Biogeographic range shifts (Neogene-present) were evaluated at regional and local scales. The role of traits as drivers of different range dynamics was evaluated using random forest models. The magnitude and direction of biogeographic range shifts were different at both spatial scales. At a regional scale, 34% of genera contracted their ranges, disappearing from the TPSA. At a local scale, a similar proportion of genera expanded and contracted their southern endpoints of distribution. The models showed a high precision at both spatial scales of analyses, but the relative importance of predictor variables differed. At a regional scale, disappearing genera tended to have a higher tolerance to salinity, lower sea surface temperature (SST) range, and smaller body sizes. At a local scale, genera contracting their ranges tended to live at greater depths, tolerate lower levels of primary productivity, and show a reduced tolerance to higher and lower SST ranges. The magnitude and direction of the changes in the range distribution were scale dependent and variable across the genera. Hence, multiple environmental exogenous factors interacted with taxon traits during the Neogene, creating a mosaic of biogeographic dynamics. © 2018 The Paleontological Society.

The impact of these ancient climatic events on the evolutionary trajectories of organisms provides clues on the organismal response to climate change, including extinction, migration and persistence. Here, we examine the evolutionary response to climate cooling/warming events of the clusioid families Calophyllaceae, Podostemaceae and Hypericaceae (CPH clade) and the genus Hypericum as test cases. Location: Holarctic. Time period: Late Cretaceous–Cenozoic. Major taxa studied: Angiosperms. Methods: We use palaeoclimate simulations, species distribution models and phylogenetic comparative approaches calibrated with fossils. Results: Ancestral CPH lineages could have been distributed in the Holarctic 100 Ma, occupying tropical subhumid assemblages, a finding supported by the fossil record. Expansion to closed-canopy tropical rain forest habitats occurred after 60 Ma, in the Cenozoic, in agreement with earlier ideas of a post-Cretaceous origin of current tropical rain forest. Posterior Cooling during the Eocene triggered diversification declines in CPH tropical lineages, and was associated with a climatic shift towards temperate affinities in Hypericum. Hypericum subsequently migrated to tropical mountains, where it encountered different temperate conditions than in the Holarctic. Main conclusions: We hypothesize that most clusioid CPH lineages failed to adapt to temperate regimes during periods of Cenozoic climate change, and went extinct in the Holarctic. In contrast, boreotropical descendants including Hypericum that underwent niche evolution demonstrated selective advantages as climates became colder. Our results point toward macroevolutionary trajectories involving the altering fates of closely related clades that adapt to periods of global climate change versus those that do not. Moreover, they suggest the hypothesis that potentially many clades, particularly inhabitants of boreotropical floras, were likely extirpated from the Holarctic and persist today (if at all) in more southern tropical locations. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",boreotropical flora; climate cooling; diversification; fossils; Hypericum; niche evolution,cooling; evolution; extinction; flora; fossil; niche; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; Clusiaceae; Hypericum; Magnoliophyta; Malpighiales; Podostemaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044308437,,FALSE,

Studying Holocene vegetation dynamics at the fynbos–succulent karoo boundary may provide insights into the resilience or sensitivity of fynbos to climate change. In this study, fossil pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal data spanning ~5500 to −50 cal. yr BP were generated from an accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon-dated sediment core extracted directly at the present-day fynbos–succulent karoo biome boundary at Groenkloof, a site in the Kamiesberg Mountains of Namaqualand, South Africa. Contrary to expectations, during the Mid-Holocene Altithermal from 5480 to 4025 cal. yr BP, fynbos and fire thrived through summer moisture subsidies associated with enhanced sub-tropical easterly flow. Subsequent cooling from 4025 to 2005 cal. yr BP resulted in enhanced summer drought and overall fynbos biome contraction, though woody fynbos shrubs persisted through physiological adaptations to drought. Desert succulents typical of the succulent karoo, such as those of Aizoaceae and Crassulaceae, failed to colonise the emergent niche space, resulting in dominance of an ambiguous grassy, asteraceous fynbos. More recent wetting associated with the ‘Little Ice Age’ Holocene temperature minima from 695 to 100 cal. yr BP prompted a resurgence in fynbos abundance, but frequent fire driven by pastoralists appears to have reduced the fynbos community’s functional diversity. Palaeoecological data from the Kamiesberg suggest that both climatic buffering of mountain refugia and high physiological resistance among certain fynbos taxa have contributed to the biome’s long-term resilience.

In Uruguay, two pinniped species breed sympatrically: Arctocephalus australis, with a growing population, and Otaria flavescens, which has a declining population. Given their contrasting population growth trends, we explored how their trophic patterns varied across age-classes over seven decades using dentin collagen δ13C and δ15N values in teeth sampled from stranded organisms. Dentin collagen accumulates isotopic information in annual growth layers, providing sequential information on an animal’s diet throughout its life. Dentin collagen annual growth layers in 50 A. australis teeth and 37 O. flavescens teeth from individuals stranded over ~ 70 years were processed for isotopic analysis. Importantly, δ13C decreased over time in both species (0.024–0.027‰ year–1 in A. australis, and 0.028–0.035‰ in O. flavescens); this pattern reflects the influence of the Suess Effect, a global phenomenon of decreasing δ13C values in marine ecosystems. Isotopic values were relatively constant over time, suggesting that these species maintained a stable trophic niche during the seven decades examined, with O. flavescens exhibiting higher δ13C and δ15N values. Within each species, there was considerable isotopic niche overlap between different age-classes; however, both species occupied different isotopic niches regardless of age-class during all decades. The isotopic niches of the two species converged during the 2000s. Primarily responsible for this convergence were adult A. australis, which overlapped with juvenile and young adult O. flavescens. Moreover, we propose that before the 2000s A. australis fed on prey from different trophic levels while O. flavescens varied its feeding habitat. Our results suggest that these top predators reflect anthropogenic and environmental changes that have occurred over the last seven decades in Uruguayan waters. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,age-related difference; bioindicator; dentition; diet; environmental change; historical ecology; historical record; human activity; isotopic analysis; juvenile; niche; niche overlap; paleoecology; pinniped; population decline; population density; population growth; sympatry; young population; Uruguay; Arctocephalus australis; Otaria byronia; Otariidae; Pinnipedia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043252922,,FALSE,

Here we build ecological niche models using MAXENT and test whether selecting predictor variables based on biological knowledge and selecting ecologically realistic response curves can improve cross-time distributional predictions. We also evaluate how the method chosen for extrapolation into nonanalog conditions affects the prediction. We do so by estimating the potential distribution of a montane shrew (Mammalia, Soricidae, Cryptotis mexicanus) at present and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Because it is tightly associated with cloud forests (with climatically determined upper and lower limits) whose distributional shifts are well characterized, this species provides clear expectations of plausible vs. implausible results. Response curves for the MAXENT model made using variables selected via biological justification were ecologically more realistic compared with those of the model made using many potential predictors. This strategy also led to much more plausible geographic predictions for upper and lower elevational limits of the species both for the present and during the LGM. By inspecting the modeled response curves, we also determined the most appropriate way to extrapolate into nonanalog environments, a previously overlooked factor in studies involving model transfer.

The objective of this study was to analyse if potential changes in the composition and the geographical location of areas of endemism (AEs) for beetles and mammals during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the mid-Holocene (MH) or the Last Interglacial (LIG) have influenced the definition of the MTZ in the present. Location: Mexico and Central America. Methods: Ecological niche models (ENM) were generated describing the current distribution of 218 species associated with the MTZ and then transferred to three periods into the past. A parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) was run to identify current AEs. The transferred models of each set of species that form the current AEs were used to assess if the geographical ranges of the species’ ecological niches changed over time, or whether they remained stable supporting the validation of the AEs during three past recent periods (LGM, MH and LIG). Results: Two current AEs were detected that persisted geographically during the three past periods (LGM, MH and LIG). Main conclusions: The results show that some AEs change through time as a response of climate, whereas others remained stable. Thus, the MTZ could be considered as a dynamic zone at least over the last 130,000 years. The climate analysis of the AEs allows them to be recognized either as true spatio-temporal units, or as temporarily restricted patterns of co-distribution resulting from changes in climate over time. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",biogeography; ecological niche modelling; Mammalia; Nearctic; Neotropical; parsimony analysis of endemicity; Passalidae; Pleistocene; Scarabaeidae,beetle; biogeographical region; biogeography; ecological modeling; endemism; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; Last Interglacial; mammal; Nearctic Region; paleoclimate; parsimony analysis; persistence; Pleistocene; population distribution; species richness; transition element; transition zone; Mexico [North America]; Coleoptera; Mammalia; Passalidae; Scarabaeidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040724181,,TRUE,

We studied a montane stream-dwelling insect, Metrocoris sichuanensis, to explore the relative roles played by these two factors in population genetic connectivity. Location: Sichuan Basin, China. Methods: Mitochondrial (COI, COII, Cytb, 16S) and nuclear (EF-1α, ITS1) markers were sequenced from 208 individuals. Suitable habitat shifts from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present were predicted through fine-tuned ecological niche modelling (ENM). Phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses were conducted to reveal the population genetic structure. Intraspecific divergence and expansion times were estimated using beast. Finally, the least cost path (LCP) method coupled with migrate analysis was used to identify possible dispersal corridors and estimate the asymmetric gene flow. Results: Our ENM results suggested that population habitat connectivity did not change both in the LGM and current conditions. Whole haplotypes were separated into four highly supported clades/haplogroups that exhibited strong geographical structure. The splitting events between the four lineages likely date back to the Early Pleistocene. Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) indicated a moderate demographic growth from the LGM to the present. A putative dispersal corridor was detected along the Longmen Mountains thrust belt, with unidirectional gene flow from north to south. Main conclusion: Our findings support the geographical isolation of the genetic lineages and a deep early Pleistocene split in M. sichuanensis. Landscape connectivity analysis incorporating the genetic data and the ENM prediction revealed that population genetic connectivity was strongly associated with stable climatic habitats shaped by complex topography. The drainage system might have assisted the rapid movement of populations along the Longmen Mountains thrust belt.

Niche evolution is poorly understood at both the macroecological and macroevolutionary scales, as niches can shift over short periods of time but appear to change more slowly over longer timescales. Although reconstructing past niches has always been a major concern for palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists, only a few recent studies have successfully determined the factors that affect niche evolution. Here, we compare the evolution of climatic niches in four main groups of terrestrial vertebrates using a modelling approach integrating both palaeontological and neontological data, and large-scale datasets that contain information on the current distributions, phylogenetic relationships and fossil records for a total of 11,465 species. By reconstructing historical shifts in geographical ranges and climatic niches, we show that niche shifts are significantly faster in endotherms (birds and mammals) than in ectotherms (squamates and amphibians). We further demonstrate that the diversity patterns of the four clades are directly affected by the rate of niche evolution, with fewer latitudinal shifts in ectotherms. © 2017 The Author(s).",,animal; animal dispersal; biodiversity; climate; comparative study; ecosystem; evolution; physiology; thermoregulation; vertebrate; Animal Distribution; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Body Temperature Regulation; Climate; Ecosystem; Vertebrates,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041112357,,TRUE,

Only Drimys occurs in South America. Because of their Cretaceous leaves, wood and pollen fossils, and their lack of xylem vessels, Winteraceae throw light on early angiosperm evolution. We describe a Winteraceae pollen tetrad from the Paleocene of Greenland, review the family's fossil record and palaeogeography and document its current climate preferences. Location: Worldwide. Methods: Extant and fossil pollen were studied with light and scanning electron microscopy. Molecular phylogenetic and character mapping approaches were used to infer the evolution of pollen characters, and 37,842 collections from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility were used to infer the climate and vegetation types occupied by today's Winteraceae and to compare them to the Paleocene climate and vegetation of Greenland as inferred from the fossil record of other families. Results: Winteraceae are the only flowering plants with persistent, acalymmate tetrads composed of ulcerate grains with a distinct reticulate sculpturing. The tetrad described here as Pseudowinterapollis agatdalensis Grímsson & Zetter spec. nov. comes from Agatdalen valley in western Greenland and dates to the Early Paleocene, Danian, 64–62 Ma. It shows the complete character suite of modern Winteraceae and overlaps the LM characters of the three previously known Pseudowinterapollis species from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The palaeoflora of the Agatdal Formation consisted of a mixed deciduous–evergreen forest resembling habitats where Winteraceae occur today. Main conclusions: Macro- and microfossil records of Winteraceae extend back to the Upper Cretaceous in both Laurasia and Gondwana, and the family's biogeography, like that of its sister family, Canellaceae, cannot be understood by focusing only on southern Gondwana.

Human and climate change impacts are the principal drivers of species loss in both biomes, more severely in the Atlantic Forest. In response to species loss, the main conservation action is the creation of protected areas (PAs). Current knowledge and research on the PA network's conservation efficiency is scarce, and existing studies have mainly considered a past temporal view. In this study, we tested the efficiency of the current PA network to maintain climatically stable areas (CSAs) across the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. To this, we used an ecological niche modeling approach to biome and paleoclimatic simulations. We propose three categories of conservation priority areas for both biomes, considering CSAs, PAs and intact forest remnants. The biomes vary in their respective PA networks' protection efficiency. Regarding protect CSAs, the Amazon PA network is four times more efficient than the Atlantic Forest PA network. New conservation efforts in these two forest biomes require different approaches.

Here, we propose a spatial diversification model of lineages through time (SPLIT) based on the reconstruction of palaeo-environments. We illustrate our approach using mangroves as a case study and evaluate whether habitat changes caused by plate tectonics explain the current biodiversity patterns of this group. Innovations: The SPLIT model allows one to simulate the evolutionary dynamics of species ranges by spatially linking speciation, extinction and dispersal processes to habitat changes over geological time periods. The SPLIT model provides a mechanistic expectation of speciation and extinction assuming that species are ecologically identical and not interacting. The likelihood of speciation and extinction is equivalent across species and depends on two dispersal parameters interacting with habitat dynamics (d a maximum dispersal distance and ds a distance threshold beyond which gene flow is absent). Beyond classical correlative approaches, this model tracks biodiversity dynamics under palaeo-environmental changes and provides multiple expectations (i.e., α-, β-diversity, phylogenies) that can be compared to empirical patterns. Main conclusions: The SPLIT model allows a better understanding of the origin of biodiversity by explicitly accounting for habitat changes over geological times. The simulations applied to the mangrove case study reproduced the observed longitudinal gradient in species richness, the empirical pattern of β-diversity and also provided inference on diversification rates. Future developments may include niche evolution and species interactions to evaluate the importance of non-neutral mechanisms.

Recent research has examined genetic diversity patterns under current climate conditions, with little attention to the future genetic consequences for species. In this study, we combined ecological niche modeling and population genetic approaches to project future changes in genetic diversity using plastid and nuclear DNA and reconstructed distribution patterns of three circumboreal plants (Chamaedaphne calyculata, Linnaea borealis ssp. borealis, and Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum ssp. sceptrum-carolinum) in the last glacial maximum. We found that circumboreal plants could potentially lose their geographic ranges in the future (2070; 35–52% in RCP 4.5 (representative concentration pathways), 37–53% in RCP 6.0, and 56–69% in RCP 8.5), only slightly compensated by a predicted range gain of 18–33% (across the three RCPs). It is expected that future genetic diversity level could remain similar or lower than the present level. On the other hand, the homogeneity of the genetic background—a lack of admixture and domination of one gene pool in most populations of C. calyculata and L. borealis ssp. borealis—was predicted to become more pronounced in the future. Combining the paleoecological niche modeling and genetic data revealed, more precisely, the climate refugia for circumboreal plants in the Alps, central Asia, Beringia, and southern North America and the macrorefugia more restricted to the northern part of Eurasia and North America, reaching the arctic zone. © 2017, The Author(s).",AFLP; Chamaedaphne calyculata; cpDNA; Ecological niche modeling; ITS; Linnaea borealis ssp. borealis; Neutral genetic diversity; Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum ssp. carolinum; Phylogeography; Range dynamics; Refugia,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028555477,,TRUE,

Among sustainability projects, urban wind energy is emerging as a technology useful in diffusion of smart grids for energetic sustainable development and also an interesting growing niche market in which there could be new investment opportunities. Numerous projects aimed at developing wind energy production are under constructions and wind characteristics and power potential of various sites have been studied in many Mediterranean countries. The urban wind analysis may represent a new tool to complete local wind atlases including the built environment, to evaluate changes that weathering may cause in the physical and architectural state of buildings, and to analyze the dispersion of pollutants from sources to receptor sites. In this paper, an analysis of wind potential and characteristics in Taranto, Apulia, a north Jonian urban site in Italy, has been performed by using high time resolved (10 min) meteorological data collected over a time span of two years, in the aim to describe the numerical procedures adopted to perform fitting of wind speed data without using special software. This urban site, in the first year of investigation from May 1st, 2009 to April 30th, 2010, was subjected to main wind regimes that come mostly from N with 12.27% and SSW with 9.89% of total hours; the calm occurred with a frequency of 10.94%. In the second year, from May 1st, 2010 to April 30th, 2011, the winds also blown predominantly from N with 12.56% of the total annual hours, and SSW with 9.33%, while the calms reached 11.08%. Dispersion of pollutants emitted from various sources among cement factory, a quarry/landfill, a refinery and the steelworks, poses serious health risks to population mainly resident downwind the prevalent wind directions. Simply computed mean wind speeds had values of 1.84 (sd = 0.26 m/s) in the first year and 1.90 m/s (sd = 0.30 m/s) in the second year under investigation. Weibull's k values, measuring the wind potential of the site, were higher during the spring-summer warmest months and lower during the autumn-winter; the lowest appeared in November 2009 (0.639) the highest in June 2010 (1.665). Mean yearly values of k were 1.210 (sd = 0.18) in the first year and 1.065 (sd = 0.24) in the second year of the study, the correlation between the monthly values of k in the years under consideration was R2 = 0.59 (p = 0.043) indicating that although variations occurred, the wind potential remain partly unaltered from one year to the other examined. LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the wind turbines chosen among the 35 ones listed in the “Catalogue of European Urban Wind Turbine Manufactures”, excluding those with rated power below 0.1 kW, ranged from 0.12 to 10.6 €/kWh and differs slightly in the two years examined. The values were competitive with some off-shore and on-shore installations, biogas and photovoltaic, but it does not consider pollution costs and subsidies. The proposed solution was economically viable, also by considering the possible integration in a hybrid photovoltaic-wind system, or fossil-based heat generator system supplemented by solar photovoltaic and wind energy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Levelized cost of electricity; Sustainability; Taranto; Urban development; Urban wind turbine; Weibull distribution function,Costs; Distribution functions; Economics; Health risks; Investments; Meteorology; Pollution; Smart power grids; Solar power generation; Steel; Steel construction; Sustainable development; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Investment opportunities; Levelized cost of electricities; Mediterranean countries; Sustainability project; Sustainable urban development; Taranto; Urban development; Wind energy production; Urban growth,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038818980,,FALSE,

It includes the ecology of ferns, and their entire history, from their first appearance through currently living specimens. Ferns have been an important part of plant assemblages, from as far back as the Palaeozoic. The first ferns (Pteridophyta) appeared in the Devonian, and separation of the ordinal-ranked clades can be traced back at least to the Carboniferous Period (Taylor et al., 2009). The earliest representatives of ferns of the Cladoxylopsida type are known from the Middle Devonian. They were characterized anatomically by a dissected vascular system, consisting of a variable number of primary xylem segments and radially elongate primary xylem ribs (Berry and Stein, 2000). The largest dispersion of ferns was during the Carboniferous period. It was a large expansion of herbaceous, epiphytic and tree ferns, for example, genera Discopteris Stur, Oligocarpia Göppert, Pecopteris Brongniart, and Sphenopteris Brongniart. The era of the Upper Devonian through the Permian is called the Younger Palaeophytic (Kvaček, 2000), and it saw the growth of fernlike fronds, called Pteridosperms. Their fossils are often confused with true ferns, and they are found together with sphenophytes, lycophyte trees and Cordaites. These plants were the largest and most extensive members of forests during the Carboniferous, and they form an important component of today's black coal seams. During the Upper Permian, all gymnosperm numbers declined, although ferns still played a significant role and kept their ecological niche. The subsequent era, from the Triassic through the Lower Cretaceous is called the Mesophytic (Kvaček, 2000). In the Upper Cretaceous, populations of ferns declined, and angiosperms became more abundant. This change of population dominance signalled the beginning of the Cenophytic era. However, even today there are places where ferns are dominant. Currently, more than 10,000 species can be found around the world in a wide variety of habitats (Taylor et al., 2009). © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144257513,,FALSE,

Moreover, the modern fauna is reduced in species diversity compared to the Pleistocene, following the extinction of several specialized grazers in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. How did this state develop, and how might it be connected to climatic change during the Holocene? To better understand this development, we obtained extensive carbon and oxygen stable light isotope data from herbivore tooth enamel samples from Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa, spanning about 12,000–500 cal. BP. This is a unique dataset since it is the only site in the southern Kalahari with a robust chronometric record and well-preserved faunal remains for the last 12,000 years without significant gaps. Combining the stable isotopes with pollen and micromammal data from Wonderwerk Cave, we have explored shifts in the proportions of C3 and C4 plants and moisture availability. Although climate remained generally semi-arid for much of this period, the results show significant hydrological and vegetation shifts in the sequence, particularly with the strengthening of summer rainfall in the mid-Holocene. The results for the sixteen herbivore species reveal a reinforcement of the grazer-browser niche partitioning through the Holocene and shows how niche specialization follows changes in local vegetation composition. In the light of this reconstruction of the local ecology we discuss grazer extinctions, human adaptations, and the drivers behind climatic changes in the summer rainfall zone of southern Africa. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",C4 plants; Faunal turnover; Holocene; Later Stone Age; Paleogeography; Southern Ocean; Stable isotopes; Summer rainfall; δ13C; δ18O,Animals; Carbon; Caves; Climate change; Isotopes; Mammals; Plants (botany); Rain; Tooth enamel; C4 plant; Faunal turnover; Holocenes; Paleogeography; Southern ocean; Stable isotopes; Stone age; Summer rainfall; Vegetation; C4 plant; carbon isotope; data set; enamel; extinction; herbivore; Holocene; oxygen isotope; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; rainfall; reconstruction; species diversity; stable isotope; Northern Cape; South Africa; Southern Ocean; Wonderwerk Cave; Mammalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036451061,,FALSE,

Human influences in the current “Anthropocene” epoch are exponentially impacting the environment and consequentially health. Changing ecological niches are suggested to have created health transitions expressed as modifications of immune balance from infections inflicting pathologies in the Holocene epoch (12,000 years ago) to human behaviors inflicting pathologies beginning in the Anthropocene epoch (300 years ago). A review of human immune health and adaptations responding to environmental (biological, chemical, physical, and psychological) stresses, which are influenced by social conditions, emphasize the involvement of fluctuations in immune cell subsets affecting influential gene–environment interactions. The literature from a variety of fields (anthropological, immunological, and environmental) is incorporated to present an expanded perspective on shifts in diseases within the context of immune balance and function and environmental immunology. The influences between historical and contemporary human ecology are examined in relation to human immunity. Several examples of shifts in human physiology and immunity support the premise that increased incidences of chronic diseases are a consequence of human modification of environment and lifestyle. Although the development of better health care and a broader understanding of human health have helped with better life quality and expectancy, the transition of morbidity and mortality rates from infections to chronic diseases is a cause for concern.

Here we present the first large-scale application of CRACLE (Climate Reconstruction Analysis using Coexistence Likelihood Estimation), a quantitative climate inference method that uses plant community composition as a climate proxy under the individualistic concept of plant community assembly. The results are spatiotemporally specific estimates of temperature, precipitation, available moisture, and seasonal patterns that are consistent with well understood global climate patterns but provide previously unavailable detail and precision of the regional paleoclimate in western North America. Rapid warming is estimated at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, at a conservative estimate of ca. 1°C per millennium. Previously projected future temperature increases suggest a rate of increase of more than 2°C over the next century, an astonishing 10× the rate experienced at any point during the past 50,000 years in Western North America.

Ecologists view the community’s profile of strategies for exploiting particular spatial and dietary niches; a quantitative summary of these strategies when compared across locales from a variety of habitat types demonstrates striking similarities in the communities that live in similar habitats regardless of their location. Recognizing that communities can be compared across space, paleoecologists implemented community studies across time in an effort to reconstruct past environments. This synecological approach to paleoenvironmental reconstruction may be thought of as holistic, since it is not restricted to a single mammal family. However, thorough explorations of how fossil and extant communities differ have revealed significant dissimilarities brought about by the taphonomic history of paleontological assemblages. Techniques have been developed for addressing differences between the modern comparative community sample and the paleontological sample to which it is compared, but recent research conducted by both neo- and paleoecologists has suggested that there are unappreciated differences between modern habitats, as well. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Community analysis; Ecological diversity; Ecomorphology; Niche; Synecology; Taxon-free,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055735560,,TRUE,*

Cubs prove especially vulnerable to harsh weather conditions, where drought and food shortages exacerbate the severity of pandemic juvenile coccidial parasite infections. Crucially, weather variability, rather than just warming trends, stresses badgers, by destabilising their bioclimatic niche. Summer droughts cause mortality, even driving genetic selection; and while milder winters generally benefit badgers, less time spent in torpor leads to more road casualties. Similar effects also operate over a wide spatial scale in Ireland, impacting regional badger densities and bodyweights.

The isolation of xeric valleys surrounded by complex mountain ranges in Oaxaca supplies an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of the Pleistocene events on xeric species. To test for the alternative hypotheses of Pleistocene glacial refugia, we used sequences of two chloroplast markers to examine the phylogeographic patterns of the endemic mistletoe species Psittacanthus auriculatus (Loranthaceae) across its known range in Oaxaca and conducted ecological niche modeling (ENM) to explore changes of its distribution range through present, future, and palaeo periods. Our results revealed two groups corresponding to the distribution of individuals/populations from the northern locations (western valleys), and those from southern localities at central valleys of Oaxaca. A significant genetic signal of differentiation, demographic stability, and contraction of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum predicted by ENMs strongly supported a scenario of habitat fragmentation during the Late Pleistocene. We conclude that the genetic differentiation of P. auriculatus is consistent with a model of range contraction during glacial cycles and expansion during interglacials with no major range changes under future scenarios of climate change.

In the geological record, the location of pyrite formation, overprinting from mat accretion, and post-depositional alteration also affect both fine-scale δ34S patterns and bulk δ34Spyrite values. We report μm-scale δ34S patterns in Proterozoic samples with well-preserved microbial mat textures. We show a well-defined relationship between δ34S values and sulfide mineral grain size and type. Small pyrite grains (&lt;25 μm) span a large range, tending toward high δ34S values (−54.5‰ to 11.7‰, mean: −14.4‰). Larger pyrite grains (&gt;25 μm) have low but equally variable δ34S values (−61.0‰ to −10.5‰, mean: −44.4‰). In one sample, larger sphalerite grains (&gt;35 μm) have intermediate and essentially invariant δ34S values (−22.6‰ to −15.6‰, mean: −19.4‰). We suggest that different sulfide mineral populations reflect separate stages of formation. In the first stage, small pyrite grains form near the mat surface along a redox boundary where high rates of sulfate reduction, partial closed-system sulfate consumption in microenvironments, and/or sulfide oxidation lead to high δ34S values. In another stage, large sphalerite grains with low δ34S values grow along the edges of pore spaces formed from desiccation of the mat. Large pyrite grains form deeper in the mat at slower sulfate reduction rates, leading to low δ34Ssulfide values. We do not see evidence for significant 34S-enrichment in bulk pore water sulfide at depth in the mat due to closed-system Rayleigh fractionation effects. On a local scale, Rayleigh fractionation influences the range of δ34S values measured for individual pyrite grains.

Such efforts include the need to: 1) better assess the ecology of herbaceous species, 2) understand the effects of global change drivers on the vulnerability of endemic species, 3) understand how plant functional diversity and plant–animal interactions shape community structure and function, 4) apply new technologies (cameras, drones and remote sensing proxies) to understand plant phenology in space and time, 5) unravel diversification patterns and distinguish paleoendemism from neoendemism, 6) to disentangle the ecological and evolutionary role of fire, 7) gain insight into the factors that limit ecological restoration in degraded campo rupestre, 8) increase awareness and value of ecosystem services, 9) identify essential variables, key measures and areas to conserve campo rupestre, 10) promote reviews and research comparing old ecosystems. Therefore, burgeoning literature on campo rupestre will benefit from long-term multi- and trans-disciplinary research investigating a wide array of topics, from plant ecology to ecosystem functioning to biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration.

We collected samples from 30 individuals at 24 locations for genetic analysis covering a wide range of environmental conditions. We sequenced the nuclear ITS and three non-coding regions of the chloroplast DNA and we resolved 15 isozyme loci. Potential distribution was modelled using 88 E. terscheckii presence training records and a reduced set of 10 modern bioclimatic variables. LGM and the Mid-Holocene distributions were derived by projecting bioclimatic data under present to past environmental conditions according to CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM Global Climate Models. Results: We detected high isozyme diversity towards the south. The multivariate cluster analysis yielded two groups of populations that were geographically concordant with the DNA haplotypes located north and south of a divide at 27°S. Distribution models show range expansion during the LGM in two north and south areas separated by a gap of low suitability at 27°S. Suitable areas in the south were close to current populations, while in the north, populations survived in more disjunct locations that probably suffered from founder effects. In contrast, Mid-Holocene bioclimatic conditions were relatively unsuitable in the south. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the divergence of north and south groups of E. terscheckii populations reflect long-lasting persistence through climatic cycles that were reinforced by the presence of an orogenic divide at mid-latitudes. Latitudinally divergent groups of populations should be treated as distinct evolutionary significant units that deserve independent conservation actions. Increased genetic diversity and inbreeding towards the south may guide setting up priorities for the long-term protection of a dominant element of drylands as E. terscheckii. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",arid environments; Cactaceae; chloroplast DNA; Echinopsis terscheckii; ecological niche modelling; glacial cycles; Holocene; isozyme variation; phylogeography; southern central Andes,arid region; bioclimatology; cactus; chloroplast; climate cycle; climate modeling; climate variation; cluster analysis; divergence; DNA; ecological modeling; environmental conditions; genetic analysis; geographical distribution; inbreeding; Last Glacial Maximum; niche; paleobiogeography; paleoecology; persistence; polymorphism; range expansion; regional climate; topography; tropical region; Andes; Argentina; Cactaceae; Echinopsis,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033602598,,TRUE,

We offer new insights on this debate using ecological niche modelling with combined climate–soil predictors to test both hypotheses, reconstruct the palaeovegetation of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 ka) and Mid-Holocene (Mid-H; 6 ka) and indicate the configuration of refugia areas. Location: Brazil. Time period: Last 21 ka. Major taxa studied: Biomes. Methods: We modelled the environmental space of the 10 most representative biomes with the RandomForest classifier, using climate predictors from three atmospheric general circulation models (CCSM4, MPI-ESM-P and MIROC-ESM) and soil predictors, the same for the different situations. Based on the consensus among the models, we reconstructed the palaeovegetation cover for LGM and Mid-H and used fossil pollen sites to validate the reconstructions in a direct comparison. Results: The climate in the past was cooler and wetter throughout most of the territory. The Amazon basin region was the most affected by climate change in the last 21 ka, with equatorial rain forest retracting to refugia areas, while the tropical rain forest (with climatic preferences similar to the Atlantic forest) expanded in the basin. In southern Brazil, the mixed forest (Araucaria forest) shifted to lower latitudes, while the grasslands expanded. In most biomes, the greatest changes occurred in the ecotonal zones, supported by pollen fossils. Main conclusions: With regard to Haffer's hypothesis, the forests of the Amazonian lowlands retreated to refugia areas, while the colder and wetter climate of the basin created a favourable niche for another type of forest, instead of savanna. The advance of dry vegetation was restricted to ecotonal conditions, preventing the formation of a continuous Pleistocene arc, predicted by Prado and Gibbs's hypothesis. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Amazon forest; Atlantic forest; biogeography; cerrado savanna; climate change; ecological niche models; macroecology; palaeovegetation; refuge theory; vegetation dynamics,biogeography; cerrado; climate change; ecological modeling; forest ecosystem; macroecology; niche; Pleistocene; refuge; refugium; savanna; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; Amazon Basin; Brazil; Araucaria,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031412963,,TRUE,

We ask whether ongoing climate changes can cause the loss of important gene pools from North Atlantic relict kelp forests that persisted over glacial–interglacial cycles. We use ecological niche modelling to predict genetic diversity hotspots for eight species of large brown algae with different thermal tolerances (Arctic to warm temperate), estimated as regions of persistence throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (20,000 YBP), the warmer Mid-Holocene (6,000 YBP), and the present. Changes in the genetic diversity within ancient refugia were projected for the future (year 2100) under two contrasting climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Models predicted distributions that matched empirical distributions in cross-validation, and identified distinct refugia at the low latitude ranges, which largely coincide among species with similar ecological niches. Transferred models into the future projected polewards expansions and substantial range losses in lower latitudes, where richer gene pools are expected (in Nova Scotia and Iberia for cold affinity species and Gibraltar, Alboran, and Morocco for warm-temperate species). These effects were projected for both scenarios but were intensified under the extreme RCP8.5 scenario, with the complete borealization (circum-Arctic colonization) of kelp forests, the redistribution of the biogeographical transitional zones of the North Atlantic, and the erosion of global gene pools across all species. As the geographic distribution of genetic variability is unknown for most marine species, our results represent a baseline for identification of locations potentially rich in unique phylogeographic lineages that are also climatic relics in threat of disappearing. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate change; climatic refugia; ecological niche modelling; genetic diversity; kelp forests; North Atlantic; range shifts,adaptation; brown alga; climate variation; genetic variation; geographical distribution; kelp forest; Last Glacial Maximum; niche; paleoclimate; refugium; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Phaeophyceae; Atlantic Ocean; climate change; genetic variation; kelp; phylogeography; physiology; refugium; Atlantic Ocean; Climate Change; Genetic Variation; Kelp; Phylogeography; Refugium,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027492287,,TRUE,

The same considerations, however, are rarely applied to morphological data, potentially undermining its use in evolutionary contexts. Here, we apply partition heterogeneity tests to 59 animal datasets to demonstrate that significant differences exist between the phylogenetic signal conveyed by ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ characters (bones, teeth and shells versus myology, integument etc). Furthermore, the morphological partitions differ significantly in their consistency relative to independent molecular trees. The observed morphological differences correspond with missing data biases, and as such their existence presents a problemnot only for phylogeny reconstruction, but also for interpretations of fossil data. Evolutionary inferences drawn from clades inwhich hard, readily fossilizable characters are relatively less consistent and different from other morphology (mammals, bivalves) may be less secure. More secure inferences might be drawn from the fossil record of clades that exhibit fewer differences, or exhibit more consistent hard characters (fishes, birds). In all cases, it will be necessary to consider the impact of missing data on empirical data, and the differences that exist between morphological modules. © 2017 The Authors.",Heterogeneity; Missing data; Morphology; Partition; Phylogenetics,animal; data assimilation; data set; fossil record; genetic analysis; heterogeneity; morphology; niche partitioning; phylogenetics; phylogeny; reconstruction; Animalia; Aves; Bivalvia; Mammalia; Pisces; anatomy and histology; animal; classification; evolution; fossil; invertebrate; phylogeny; vertebrate; Animals; Biological Evolution; Classification; Fossils; Invertebrates; Phylogeny; Vertebrates,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038871297,,FALSE,

We tested three mechanisms commonly invoked to explain the LDG: ecological opportunity, evolutionary rates and biogeographical history. Location: New World and Eurasia. Time period: Oligocene–Present. Major taxa studied: New World swallowtail butterfly clade (Papilio: Agehana, Alexanoria, Chilasa, Heraclides and Pterourus). Methods: We integrated data from the most complete current phylogeny of this clade with geographical distributions of each species inferred from ecological niche models (ENMs). We tested for correlation between breadth of available abiotic ecological niche space, latitude and differential rates of diversification between tropical and non-tropical lineages. The clade's history of climatic and geographical occupancy was also reconstructed using both continuous ancestral character reconstructions and biogeographical history inferred under a dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model. We considered both latitudinal and climatic definitions of tropicality in our reconstructions. Results: There was no strong support for ecological opportunity or macroevolutionary processes as latitudinal diversity gradient drivers. Instead, we recovered discordant patterns in phylogenetic reconstructions of latitudinal geographical range and suitable abiotic climate conditions. Heraclides are likely to have originated and diversified in climatically and latitudinally tropical environments before some lineages dispersed to temperate habitats. The Alexanoria + Chilasa + Pterourus clade is likely to have originated in climatically and latitudinally temperate habitat before dispersing and diversifying; some lineages are likely to have dispersed into the latitudinal tropics via highland temperate-analogue environments. Main conclusions: The LDG in New World swallowtails results from complex interactions between ecological niche evolution and biogeographical history; both out-of-the-tropics and into-the-tropics processes have contributed to the LDG. Our results present an example where temperate zones appear to be a source, instead of a sink, for biodiversity. Our results emphasize the need to consider biogeographical history not only from the perspective of shifts in geographical space, but also in terms of constraints enforced by ecological niche conservatism. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",ecological niche modelling; Neotropics; Papilionidae; tropicality,biogeography; butterfly; cladistics; dispersal; ecological modeling; evolutionary biology; geographical distribution; latitudinal gradient; Neotropical Region; new species; niche; paleoclimate; phylogeny; reconstruction; Heraclides; Papilio; Papilionidae; Papilioninae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034079163,,TRUE,

Nocturnality may have allowed mammals to avoid antagonistic interactions with diurnal dinosaurs during the Mesozoic. However, understanding the evolution of mammalian activity patterns is hindered by scant and ambiguous fossil evidence. While ancestral reconstructions of behavioural traits from extant species have the potential to elucidate these patterns, existing studies have been limited in taxonomic scope. Here, we use an extensive behavioural dataset for 2,415 species from all extant orders to reconstruct ancestral activity patterns across Mammalia. We find strong support for the nocturnal origin of mammals and the Cenozoic appearance of diurnality, although cathemerality (mixed diel periodicity) may have appeared in the late Cretaceous. Simian primates are among the earliest mammals to exhibit strict diurnal activity, some 52-33 million years ago. Our study is consistent with the hypothesis that temporal partitioning between early mammals and dinosaurs during the Mesozoic led to a mammalian nocturnal bottleneck, but also demonstrates the need for improved phylogenetic estimates for Mammalia. © 2017 The Author(s).",,animal; circadian rhythm; dinosaur; evolution; fossil; mammal; phylogeny; physiology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Circadian Rhythm; Dinosaurs; Fossils; Mammals; Phylogeny,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033399033,,FALSE,

Location: Eurasia. Methods: We used species distribution modelling, niche overlap tests and co-occurrence analysis to model climatic niche evolution and change in six different megafauna species, including three extinct (woolly mammoth, woolly rhino and steppe bison) and three extant (red deer, wolf and reindeer) species. Results: Co-occurrence analysis indicates mammoth, rhino, reindeer and steppe bison to be significantly associated to each other in the fossil record in cold, arid environments. In contrast, red deer and wolf show no evidence for strong habitat requirements, although they both tended to be associated with more humid conditions than the other megafauna. Woolly mammoth and the woolly rhino were the best adapted to the cold, arid conditions dominating the Eurasian landscapes during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Extant species did not exhibit larger climatic niches than extinct species, but changed more from one period to the next than those of extinct species. Main conclusions: Although they did not have wider climatic niches, and were the least adapted to cold climates, red deer and the wolf were able to withstand the harsh climatic conditions of the LGM. Conversely, the now extinct mammoth and woolly rhino did not survive the demise of the LGM environment. Although “cold-adapted”, reindeer survived the LGM by occupying a northerly distribution similar to today. Independent evidence indicates the steppe bison lineage might have survived in North America.

This is a trend caused by the greening of the European power grid which is to be carbon neutral by 2050. As a part of this trend, the number of power-producing buildings is growing. Even in Norway, which has a highly centralized power production based on hydropower, buildings are increasingly equipped with solar power panels. The introduction of cross-sectoral innovations like power producing buildings is likely to encounter resistance, as the conventional system and its powerful actors are challenged. The strategies to either promote or block the growth of power producing buildings in Norway have been explored employing the Strategic Niche Management framework. For this paper, 32 interviews were conducted with decision-makers and experts, both advocates and opponents of power-producing buildings. It has been found that narratives have the potential to work as a bridging device between the niche and the regime. If the narrative supporting power-producing buildings should become a bridging device, it would have to address challenges as defined by the regime incumbents.

In this study, we investigated carbon, nitrogen, and molybdenum isotopes, and iron speciation in five non-marine stratigraphic units of the Neoarchean Fortescue Group, Western Australia, that are similar in age (2.78–2.72 Ga) but differ in their hydro-geologic setting. Our data suggest that the felsic-dominated and hydrologically open lakes of the Bellary and Hardey formations were probably dominated by methanogenesis (δ13Corg = −38.7 ± 4.2‰) and biologic N2 fixation (δ15Nbulk =−0.6 ± 1.0‰), whereas the Mt. Roe, Tumbiana and Kylena Formations, with more mafic siliciclastic sediments, preserve evidence of methanotrophy (δ13Corg as low as −57.4‰, δ13Ccarb as low as −9.2‰) and NH3 loss under alkaline conditions. Evidence of oxygenic photosynthesis is recorded only in the closed evaporitic Tumbiana lakes marked by abundant stromatolites, limited evidence of Fe and S cycling, fractionated Mo isotopes (δ98/95Mo = +0.4 ± 0.4‰), and the widest range in δ13Corg (−57‰ to −15‰), suggesting oxidative processes and multiple carbon fixation pathways. Methanotrophy in the three mafic settings was probably coupled to a combination of oxidants, including O2 and SO4 2-. Overall, our results may indicate that early microbial evolution on the Precambrian Earth was in part influenced by geological parameters.

Location: South America. Methods: We generated random points in climate space of AmF and AtF and identified two major climatic groups in the shared environmental space (colder and warmer) with a K-means cluster analysis. We modelled each climatic group using eleven algorithms of ENM and selected the best model, projecting the results back to 120 ka. We used published data on South American palaeopalynology, speleothem and travertine chronology for model validation. We also accessed vertebrate molecular studies and extracted the split timing of lineages distributed both in the AmF and the AtF to test Por ()'s hypothesis in more ancient times. Results: Palynological and speleothem studies supported the results of our ENM models, indicating expansion of cold-adapted species along the SE—NW and NE routes in the LGM. The SE—NW route was also supported in the LIG, however, involving warm-adapted species. Our results support Por ()'s hypothesis and suggest that the SE—NW was established more than once in the past, involving different plant communities each time, adapted to different temperature conditions. Vertebrate molecular studies also support Por ()'s hypothesis and suggest that the SE—NW route was established since the Andean uplift. Main Conclusions: The SE—NW route is the most ancient connection route between the AmF and the AtF and probably was established since the Andean uplift and the formation of the South American monsoon system.

Main conclusions: The genetic differentiation of P. calyculatus may be explained by the combined effects of (1) geographical isolation linked to the effects of the glacial/interglacial cycles and environmental factors, driving genetic differentiation from congeners into more xeric vegetation and (2) the invasion of TMVB from east to west, suggesting a role for both colonization and glacial/interglacial cycles models. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Loranthaceae; Mesoamerica; Mexico; mistletoes; phylogeography; Pleistocene; Psittacanthus; Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt,Bayesian analysis; climate effect; colonization; ecological modeling; elevation; genetic differentiation; genetic variation; glacial-interglacial cycle; intraspecific variation; niche; paleoecology; parasitic plant; phylogeography; population distribution; population structure; range expansion; vegetation dynamics; volcanism; Mexico [North America]; Oaxaca; Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt; Loranthaceae; Psittacanthus; Psittacidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020189365,,TRUE,?

Opinion is divided as to whether birds competitively displaced pterosaurs from small-body size niches or whether the two groups coexisted with little competition. Previous studies of Mesozoic birds and pterosaurs compared measurements of homologous limb bones to test these hypotheses. However, these characters probably reflect differing ancestries rather than ecologies. Here, competition and ecological separation were tested for using multivariate analyses of functionally equivalent morphological characters. As well as using characters from the fore- and hindlimbs, these analyses also included measurements of the lower jaw. The results of this study indicate that pterosaurs had relatively longer jaws, shorter metatarsals and shorter brachial regions compared with birds of similar size. Contrary to the results of previous studies, the distal wing was not important for separating the two clades in morphospace owing to the inclusion of the primary feathers in this unit. The differences found here indicate ecological separation based on differences in size, locomotory features and feeding adaptations. Thus, instead of one group displacing the other, birds and pterosaurs appear to have adopted distinctive ecological strategies throughout their period of coexistence. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The fossil record suggests that most extant animal phyla appeared in a geologically brief interval, with the oldest unequivocal bilaterian body fossils found in the Early Cambrian. Molecular clocks and biomarkers provide independent estimates for the timing of animal origins, and both suggest a cryptic Neoproterozoic history for Metazoa that extends considerably beyond the Cambrian fossil record. We report an assemblage of ichnofossils from Ediacaran-Cambrian siltstones in Brazil, alongside U-Pb radioisotopic dates that constrain the age of the oldest specimens to 555-542 Myr. X-ray microtomography reveals three-dimensionally preserved traces ranging from 50 to 600 μm in diameter, indicative of small-bodied, meiofaunal tracemakers. Burrow morphologies suggest they were created by a nematoid-like organism that used undulating locomotion to move through the sediment. This assemblage demonstrates animal-sediment interactions in the latest Ediacaran period, and provides the oldest known fossil evidence for meiofaunal bilaterians. Our discovery highlights meiofaunal ichnofossils as a hitherto unexplored window for tracking animal evolution in deep time, and reveals that both meiofaunal and macrofaunal bilaterians began to explore infaunal niches during the late Ediacaran. © 2017 The Author(s).",,anatomy and histology; animal; Brazil; evolution; fossil; invertebrate; paleontology; Animals; Biological Evolution; Brazil; Fossils; Invertebrates; Paleontology,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035082231,,FALSE,

This mass species extinction testifies end-Cretaceous catastrophic bioevent. The Cretaceous species remain became apparently extinct gradually during the earliest Danian. In fact the unkeeled globotruncanids (Globotruncanella and Rugoglobigerina) as well as the small heterohelicids (Heterohelix and Pseudoguembelina) were also affected by extinction and they were reworked in the basal Danian. Except guembelitriids which persisted longer time. The sudden species extinctions were selective, eliminating geographically restricted large, complex, and deeper dwelling forms (i.e., globotruncanids and large heterohelicids). Contrary, few cosmopolitan small, simple surface-subsurface dwellers (i.e., guembelitriids among small heterohelicids and hedbergellids) crossed the K/Pg boundary and survived the catastrophic event. This selective bioevent is related to the end-Cretaceous bolide and produced ejecta impact inducing major environmental changes as decrease in temperature, collapse of nutriment, and flow breakdown in the water mass stratification. Our geochemical results (δ13C negative shift, δ 18O positive shift, and trace elements anomalies) are consistent with the cooling due to the collision winter triggering collapse of nutriment. Especially the δ 18O values across the upper Maastrichtian and the K-Pg transition in Izeh section although they are lower; they report similar fluctuations to those in El Kef section. Thus these lower values may be indicative of somewhat warmer water at the sea floor. Besides, like as elsewhere, in Izeh, this Cretaceous end catastrophic bioevent is followed by a delayed gradual recovery. Thus, immediately after the K/Pg boundary was created a nearly empty niche in which persisted few Cretaceous survivors with dwarf individuals. These survivors despite they suffered very stressful environmental conditions, they constituted the root stock of globigerinids from which the Cenozoic planktonic foraminiferal species evolved and developed carnivorous food diet. © 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Evolution; Extinction; K/Pg boundary; Planktonic foraminifera; Stable isotopes; Survivorship; Trace elements; Turnover,bacterioplankton; Cenozoic; cooling; Cretaceous; Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; environmental conditions; evolution; Maastrichtian; mass extinction; morphology; planktonic foraminifera; seafloor; stable isotope; survivorship; trace element; water mass; Iran; Izeh; Khuzestan; Zagros Basin; Foraminifera; Globigerinidae; Globotruncanella; Globotruncanidae; Hedbergellidae; Heterohelicidae; Heterohelix; Pseudoguembelina; Rugoglobigerina,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031893810,,FALSE,

We studied community assembly processes following tropical forest restoration efforts, using dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) as a focal taxon to investigate taxonomic and functional patterns of biodiversity recovery. We evaluated the relative importance of the local environment (i.e., canopy cover, understory cover, tree basal area, and soil texture), landscape context (i.e., habitat patch proximity and availability and percentage of surrounding area classified as natural forest or Eucalyptus spp. plantation), and space (i.e., spatial proximity of the study areas to estimate dispersal limitation or unmeasured spatially structured processes) on dung beetle species and functional trait composition across a gradient of 15 restoration sites in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We also assessed which factors were the primary determinants in the establishment of individual dung beetle functional groups, classified according to size, food relocation habit, diet, and period of flight activity. Both species and functional trait composition were most strongly influenced by the local environment, indicating that assembly was predominantly driven by niche-based processes. Most of the variation explained by space was co-explained by local environment and landscape context, ruling out a strong influence of dispersal limitation and random colonization on assembly following restoration. In addition, nearly all of the variance explained by landscape context was co-explained by local environment, suggesting that arrival and establishment at a site depends on both local and landscape-scale environmental factors. Despite strong evidence for niche-based assembly, a large amount of variation remained unexplained in all models, suggesting that stochastic processes and/or unmeasured environmental variables also play an important role. The relative importance of local environment, landscape context, and space changed considerably when analyzing the assembly mechanisms of each functional group separately. Therefore, to recover distinct functional traits in restoration sites, it may be necessary to manipulate different components of the local environment and surrounding landscape. Overall, this study shows that assembly rules can help to better understand recovery processes, enabling improvement of future restoration efforts. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.",Atlantic Forest; chronosequence; community composition; dispersal limitation; environmental filtering; functional traits; niche-based community assembly; restoration practices; Scarabaeinae; variance partitioning,assembly rule; beetle; biodiversity; chronosequence; community composition; dispersal; fossil assemblage; functional group; landscape change; niche partitioning; restoration ecology; taxonomy; tropical forest; variance analysis; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Coleoptera; Eucalyptus; Scarabaeinae; animal; animal dispersal; beetle; Brazil; environment; forest; Markov chain; physiology; population density; season; tree; tropic climate; Animal Distribution; Animals; Brazil; Coleoptera; Environment; Forests; Population Density; Seasons; Stochastic Processes; Trees; Tropical Climate,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028620445,,FALSE,

Speculation is based on the contemporary abundance of these shrubs in overgrazed areas throughout the highlands. This study presents fossil pollen records for the eastern Lesotho Highlands which confirm the presence of this species intermittently throughout the past ~6000 cal yr BP. In so doing, this study refutes claims that the species was introduced anthropogenically within the past 100 years, and of its narrow definition as a Karoo species invasive in Lesotho. The intermittent appearance of this species in the pollen record, however, indicates that it is climate sensitive, colonising the wetlands under conditions unsuitable to other plant species.

This has allowed, for example, to calibrate models under past climate conditions or to validate projected models calibrated on current species distributions. However, these data also bear certain shortcomings when used in SDMs that may hinder the resulting ecological outcomes and eventually lead to misleading conclusions. Palaeodata may not be equivalent to present data, but instead frequently exhibit limitations and biases regarding species representation, taxonomy and chronological control, and their inclusion in SDMs should be carefully assessed.

It is known that a more seasonal dry-wet climate caused marginal forest retraction and together with cooling rearranged forest composition to some extent. This is observed in pollen records across Amazonia depicting presence of taxa at glacial times in localities where they do not live presently. The understanding of taxa migration is hindered by the lack of continuous interglacial-glacial lowland records. We present new data from a known locality in NW Amazonia (Six Lakes Hill), showing a vegetation record that probably started during MIS 5 (130–71 ka) and lasted until the onset of the Holocene. The vegetation record unravels a novel pattern in tree taxa migration: (1) from the beginning of this cycle Podocarpus and Myrsine are recorded and (2) only later do Hedyosmum and Alnus appear. The latter group is largely restricted to montane biomes or more distant locations outside Amazonia, whereas the first is found in lowlands close to the study site on sandy soils. These findings imply that Podocarpus and Myrsine responded to environmental changes equally and this reflects their concomitant niche use in NW Amazonia. Temperature drop is not discarded as a trigger of internal forest composition change, but its effects are clearer later in the Pleniglacial rather than the Early Glacial. Therefore early climatic/environmental changes had a first order effect on vegetation that invoke alternative explanations.

The sampled layers were deposited during the Holocene, and provide evidence of riparian ecology in the region since the end of the last glacial interval. The samples were processed to extract sub-fossil macroremains (including seeds, fruits, and aquatic and terrestrial mollusc shells). Macrofossils are particularly useful for creating fine-resolution (site-specific) reconstructions. An innovative aspect of this study was the derivation of regional bioclimatic trends through time. This was achieved by applying a dual-layered weighted calibration function which incorporated the relative productivity of indicator taxa, their modelled climatic optima, and the influence of climate (temperature and precipitation) on their ecological niche. Optima and climatic influence values were calculated using the machine-learning maximum entropy environmental niche modelling tool, MAXENT, trained on global occurrence records for the taxa. This study aimed to address gaps in prior palaeoenvironmental research, allowing for a spatially explicit quantitative reconstruction of climate in the transitional foothill region near Calgary. Results indicated warm conditions immediately following glacial retreat, followed by an early to mid-Holocene cooling which coincided with the driest interval. Temperature and moisture regimes oscillated in the mid-Holocene, exhibiting the highest values for both parameters. Increased moisture was at least in part prompted by increased input from summer glacial meltwater (the result of higher summer temperatures) which added to the riparian water budget.

Divergence times were generated using BEAST to estimate when isolation in putative refugia occurred. Patterns and timing of demographic expansion was performed using Bayesian skyline plot. Putative climatic refugia resulting from Quaternary climate change were identified using paleoecological niche modeling and divergence dates compared to major vicariant events associated with Pre-Pleistocene conditions. We recovered three major mitochondrial clades corresponding to western North America (California, Baja, and across the Great Basin), east-central North America (Texas, central Mexico, New Mexico), and southwestern Arizona/northwestern Mexico. Time to most recent common ancestor for S. gracilis occurred ~1.36 Ma. Divergence times for each major clade occurred between 0.25 and 0.12 Ma, with signature of population expansion occurring 0.15 and 0.10 Ma.

This study supports PPD in shaping species-level diversity compared to QCC-driven changes at the intraspecific level for Spilogale, similar to the patterns reported for other small mammals (e.g., rodents and bats).

By fitting phylogenetic macroevolutionary models to a dataset consisting of living and extinct species, we show that mysticetes underwent a clade-wide shift in their mode of body size evolution during the Plio-Pleistocene. This transition, from Brownian motion-like dynamics to a trended random walk towards larger size, is temporally linked to the onset of seasonally intensified upwelling along coastal ecosystems. High prey densities resulting from wind-driven upwelling, rather than abundant resources alone, are the primary determinant of efficient foraging in extant mysticetes and Late Pliocene changes in ocean dynamics may have provided an ecological pathway to gigantisminmultiple independent lineages. © 2017 The Author(s).",Body size; Fossil; Macroevolution; Phylogeny; Tempo and mode; Trend,body size; evolution; fossil record; macroecology; phylogenetics; phylogeny; Pleistocene; random walk method; whale; Mysticeti; Vertebrata; animal; body size; Cetacea; evolution; phylogeny; sea; Animals; Biological Evolution; Body Size; Oceans and Seas; Phylogeny; Whales,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019708400,,FALSE,

Today, they are widely spread and represent a major pest to local human populations. This complex, therefore, represents an accurate model for investigating the roles of climate change and human impact in shaping Quaternary faunal diversity and distribution. Many gray areas still exist regarding the systematics, ecology and geographical distribution of this complex, for both present and past populations. The purpose of this study is to compare modern genotyped and fossil Meriones specimens in order to 1) clarify the current systematics and distribution of the Meriones populations of the shawii/grandis complex, 2) document the taxonomic diversity in fossil Meriones from northwestern Africa, and 3) track their phenotypic and biogeographic evolution through time. To answer these questions we used geometric morphometrics on skulls (landmarks) and first upper molars (landmarks and sliding landmarks). We evidenced the existence of two morpho-groups within the M. shawii/grandis complex, with a clear geographic pattern (M. grandis in Morocco vs. M. shawii in Algeria and Tunisia). Currently only one morpho-group, attributed to M. grandis, seems to exist in Morocco, with a small overlap with M. shawii in the most eastern part of the country. However, according to fossil data, M. shawii was also present in Atlantic Morocco during the Late Pleistocene. We have also highlighted the impact of Holocene climate change and habitat anthropization on this arid adapted group. During the Middle Holocene, a major climatic event (last interglacial optimum) seems to have induced a demographic collapse in Moroccan populations and the disappearance of the shawii clade from Morocco (except in the most eastern areas). Both species then re-expanded, benefitting from the increasing aridity and the new ecological niche driven by agriculture dispersal from the Neolithic onwards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Anthropic impact; Climate change; Geometric morphometrics; Gerbillinae; Holocene; Late Pleistocene; Maghreb,Climate models; Ecology; Geographical distribution; Mammals; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Anthropic impact; Geometric morphometrics; Gerbillinae; Holocenes; Late Pleistocene; Maghreb; Climate change; abundance; anthropogenic effect; archaeology; climate variation; environmental change; fossil record; geographical distribution; geometry; Holocene; morphometry; paleobiogeography; Pleistocene; rodent; species complex; Morocco; North Africa; Gerbillinae; Meriones; Rodentia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017318875,,FALSE,?

Taphonomic analysis of the fossil assemblage has shown evidence of carnivore involvement, particularly hyenas, in the bone accumulating process. In this study we use a mathematical approach based on Leslie matrices to quantify the biomass of ungulates available to the members of the carnivore guild as well as the pattern of resource partitioning and competition intensity among them. The results obtained show that although the biomass of primary consumers available to the secondary consumers was lower than the value expected under optimal conditions, more than half the individuals and biomass of carnivores expected would be reached, which allowed a viable ecosystem in Venta Micena. In fact, the biomass available for the members of the carnivore guild is 25–30% greater than the estimates obtained for two nearby sites, Barranco León-D and Fuente Nueva-3, which are somewhat younger (∼1.4 Ma) and preserve the oldest evidence on human presence in this region. Given that the competition intensity estimated in the carnivore guild of Venta Micena was lower than in the latter sites, this suggests that the timing of the first human dispersal in Western Europe was probably not a matter of ecological opportunity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Early pleistocene; Large mammals; Leslie matrices; Orce; Paleoecology,Biomass; Estimation; Mammals; Early pleistocene; Large mammals; Leslie matrices; Orce; Paleoecology; Ecology; carnivore; competition (ecology); dispersal; fossil assemblage; guild; mammal; niche partitioning; numerical model; paleoecology; Pleistocene; resource availability; taphonomy; Andalucia; Baza Basin; Granada [Andalucia]; Orce; Spain; Venta Micena; Mammalia; Ungulata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017241883,,FALSE,

Whereas such assumptions are testable in modern populations, it is unclear whether niche conservatism holds over deeper time spans and over very large geographic ranges. Hyaenids occupied a diversity of ecological niches over time and space, and until the end-Pleistocene they occurred in Europe and most of Asia, with Asian populations of Crocuta suggested as being genetically distinct from their closest living relatives. Further, little is known regarding whether and how the dietary ecology of extinct populations of Crocuta differed from those of their extant African counterparts. Here, we use a multiproxy approach to assess an assumption of conserved dietary ecology in late Pleistocene extant spotted hyenas via finite element analysis, dental microwear texture analysis, and a novel dental macrowear method (i.e., whether teeth are minimally, moderately, or extremely worn, as defined by degree of dentin exposure) proposed here. Results from finite element simulations of the masticatory apparatus of Chinese and African Crocuta demonstrate lower skull stiffness and higher stress in the orbital region of the former when biting with carnassial teeth, suggesting that Chinese Crocuta could not process prey with the same degree of efficiency as extant Crocuta crocuta. Dental microwear texture data further support this interpretation, as Chinese Crocuta have intermediate and indistinguishable complexity values (indicative of hard-object feeding) between the extant African lion (Panthera leo) and extant hyenas (C. crocuta, Hyaena hyaena, and Parahyaena brunnea), being most similar to the omnivorous P. brunnea. The use of dental macrowear to infer dietary behavior may also be possible in extinct taxa, as evinced by dietary correlations between extant African feliforms and dental macrowear assignments. Collectively, this multiproxy analysis suggests that Chinese Crocuta may have exhibited dietary behavior distinct from that of living C. crocuta, and assumptions of niche conservatism may mask significant dietary variation in species broadly distributed in time and space. © Copyright 2017 The Paleontological Society.

In this study, we combine data on ancient and contemporary landscape composition to get a comprehensive view of the factors shaping genetic variation across the populations of the scrub-legume grasshopper (Chorthippus binotatus binotatus) from the biogeographically complex region of southeast Iberia. First, we examined geographical patterns of genetic structure and employed an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to compare different plausible scenarios of population divergence. Second, we used a landscape genetic framework to test for the effects of (1) Late Miocene paleogeography, (2) Pleistocene climate fluctuations, and (3) contemporary topographic complexity on the spatial patterns of population genetic differentiation. Genetic structure and ABC analyses supported the presence of three genetic clusters and a sequential west-to-east splitting model that predated the last glacial maximum (LGM, c. 21 Kya). Landscape genetic analyses revealed that population genetic differentiation was primarily shaped by contemporary topographic complexity, but was not explained by any paleogeographic scenario or resistance distances based on climate suitability in the present or during the LGM.

Populations become isolated on either side of the newly established environmental barrier, and absence of gene flow promotes allopatric speciation, in a process that is known as ecological vicariance. If climate change altered the ancestral range gradually, such as along temporal temperature or moisture gradients, the age of divergence of disjunct species should be related to the lineage tolerance to climatic conditions. Here, we investigate this hypothesis using as a study model the African Rand Flora, a continental-scale floristic pattern that relates sister taxa distributed on either side of the Saharan Desert. Location: Africa, Macaronesia, Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East. Methods: We estimated the extant climatic tolerances of 14 Rand Flora lineages based on present occurrence data, and correlated the phylogenetic age of divergence between vicariant clades. We tested whether the tempo of the vicariance in the Rand Flora lineages was associated with the average values of their climatic niches in agreement with niche-driven divergence. We hindcasted species ranges using species distribution models combined with palaeoclimate simulations to infer the potential distribution of each lineage's ancestors. Results: We found a positive relationship between the lineage temperature niche and the age of the Rand Flora disjunction: lineages with subtropical affinities diverged first, whereas those with a higher tolerance to drier conditions (temperate or sub-xeric adaptations) exhibited younger disjunctions. The range reconstructions showed the existence of climatic corridors south of the Sahara in the wetter Late Miocene, which became interrupted during the mid-Pliocene warming event. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that climate change leading to the formation of the Sahara Desert drove Rand Flora lineages divergences along a temporal sequence that matched the climatic niche of species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",continental disjunctions; extinction; niche conservatism; Rand Flora; refuges; vicariance,allopatry; climate change; climate conditions; disjunct distribution; divergence; environmental factor; flora; gene flow; niche; phylogenetics; range size; refuge; speciation (biology); vicariance; Macaronesia; Mediterranean Sea; Middle East; Sahara,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041137020,,TRUE,

Seventy-five percent of its species richness occurs in Eurycea, one of its six genera. We hypothesized that this was the result of the transgression of the Western Interior Seaway that provided ecological opportunity via ancestral range expansion into novel geographical regions, leading to an adaptive radiation. Location: Eastern North America. Methods: We sampled all but one species and two subspecies of extant Spelerpini, including several putative species, for four genes using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches to generate a comprehensive, robust phylogeny. We used five fossil calibrations to generate a chronogram, a likelihood framework to estimate the ancestral ranges/splits of all nodes on the phylogeny, and a Bayesian inference method to estimate diversification rate shifts putting the evolution of this group into a historical biogeographical context. Results: A well-resolved, strongly supported phylogeny of the Spelerpini was recovered. Eurycea is among the oldest genera within the Spelerpini, originating c. 42 Ma with an ancestor occurring in four of five physiographical regions, each corresponding to a major Eurycea lineage. There is strong support for a rate shift in the Edwards Plateau neotenic Eurycea. Main conclusions: A pattern of niche lability was found in the Spelerpini, as opposed to a pattern of niche conservatism found in other major radiations of plethodontids in eastern North America. The genus Eurycea dispersed widely into novel regions experiencing ecological opportunity as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed.

Despite this, reproductive requirements are seldom considered when estimating species’ potential distributions. We sought to examine potentially limiting environmental factors influencing the distribution of an oviparous reptile of conservation concern with respect to the species’ survival and reproduction and to assess the implications of the species’ predicted climatic constraints on current conservation practices. We used ecological niche modeling to predict the probability of environmental suitability for the alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii). We built an annual climate model to examine survival and a nesting climate model to examine reproduction. We combined incubation temperature requirements, products of modeled soil temperature data, and our estimated distributions to determine whether embryonic development constrained the northern distribution of the species. Low annual precipitation constrained the western distribution of alligator snapping turtles, whereas the northern distribution was constrained by thermal requirements during embryonic development. Only a portion of the geographic range predicted to have a high probability of suitability for alligator snapping turtle survival was estimated to be capable of supporting successful embryonic development. Historic occurrence records suggest adult alligator snapping turtles can survive in regions with colder climes than those associated with consistent and successful production of offspring. Estimated egg-incubation requirements indicated that current reintroductions at the northern edge of the species’ range are within reproductively viable environmental conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering survival and reproduction when estimating species’ ecological niches, implicating conservation plans, and benefits of incorporating physiological data when evaluating species’ distributions. © 2016 Society for Conservation Biology",desarrollo embrionario; ecological niche model; ecología reproductiva; embryonic development; incubación; incubation; Macrochelys temminckii; Macrochelys temminckii; modelo de nicho ecológico; reproductive ecology; soil temperature; temperatura del suelo; tortugas; turtles,climate modeling; conservation planning; conservation status; ecological modeling; embryonic development; endangered species; environmental conditions; environmental factor; fossil record; incubation; life history; life history trait; reproduction; reproductive biology; reptile; soil temperature; species conservation; survival; turtle; Macroclemys; Macroclemys temminckii; Reptilia; Testudines; animal; ecology; environmental protection; life cycle stage; temperature; turtle; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Life Cycle Stages; Temperature; Turtles,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006147313,,TRUE,?

The species is currently endangered and persists only in small areas of Central Asian steppe and desert ecosystems. The investigation of the ecology of the Pleistocene saiga using stable isotope ratios (δ13C, δ15N) aimed to decipher how different their diet and habitat were from those observed nowadays in relict populations. Up to 76 samples of bone collagen of ancient saiga from Western Europe, Siberia and Eastern Beringia were analysed and compared with 52 samples of hair and bone collagen of modern specimens from Kazahkstan, Russia and Mongolia. The δ13C values of the ancient saiga do not exhibit a clear trend over time. They cover the same range of values as the modern ones, from a C3-dominated to a C3-C4-dominated mixed diet (including probably Chenopodiaceae). In contrast, the δ15N values of fossil saigas are more variable and lower on average than the extant ones. The lowest δ15N values of ancient saiga are found around the Last Glacial Maximum, reflecting the influence of the cold conditions at that time. On the other hand, fossil saiga occupying the same regions as the historical and modern populations exhibit high δ15N values similar to the modern ones, confirming ecological continuity over time. Modern saiga is thus occupying just one of its potential diverse habitats they used in the past. Therefore, the extant saiga is not a refugee species confined to a suboptimal habitat. During the late Pleistocene, the saiga occupied a separate niche compared with the other ungulates of the mammoth steppe. However, this species could also adapt to a lichen-dominated diet normally seen in reindeer, leading to an isotopic overlap between the two species in south-western France and Alaska around the Last Glacial Maximum. This adaptation allowed a geographical expansion that does not correspond to a habitat-tracking episode. Hence, the realized niche currently observed for the saiga is reduced compared with their potential capacity for adaptation, a crucially important factor for the conservation of this endangered species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon-13; Conservation paleobiology; Evolution; Mammoth steppe; Nitrogen-15; Paleoecology; Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica),Bone; Collagen; Conservation; Ecosystems; Glacial geology; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Carbon-13; Evolution; Mammoth steppe; Nitrogen-15; Paleoecology; Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica); Ecology; Beringia; carbon isotope ratio; conservation management; desert; diet; endangered species; evolutionary biology; fossil record; Last Glacial Maximum; lichen; niche; nitrogen isotope; Northern Hemisphere; paleobiology; paleoecology; range expansion; stable isotope; steppe; ungulate; Alaska; Central Asia; France; Mongolia; Russian Federation; Siberia; United States; Amaranthaceae; Rangifer tarandus; Saiga; Saiga tatarica; Ungulata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013072514,,FALSE,

Although the routes by which they migrated have been intensively analysed, the dynamics of their realized climatic niche are still largely unknown. We assess temporal changes in the climatic niche of modern humans, the geographical distribution of their climatic niche and whether niche dynamics correlate with the magnitude of climate change and cultural advances, between 46 and 11 ka. Location: Palaearctic. Methods: Using the radiocarbon dated archaeological record and spatial palaeoclimatic simulations, we quantify different parameters of the realized climatic niche of modern humans (niche overlap, niche breadth and climatic marginality) between consecutive 1000–2000 year intervals. Moreover, using climate envelope models, we map the potential distributions of modern humans for each time interval and identify the regions that remained more climatically suitable and stable for modern humans through time. Results: Between 46 and 22 ka the climatic niche of modern humans expanded, including periods of intense growth in niche breadth at 40 and 30 ka. Changes in seasonal water availability and technological innovations partly correlate with dynamics in niche parameters. We document a persistent climatically suitable mid-latitude belt in south Siberia linking western Europe to the Far East that may have facilitated human migration, and a potential climatic refugium in Beringia. Main conclusions: The climatic niche of modern humans changed across the Late Pleistocene, as the result of both climatic and cultural changes.

Previous work has shown empirically that species-rich clades are more likely to expand outside their present distributions, i.e. to overcome niche conservatism, than species-poor ones. This pattern can follow from a neutral probabilistic model of clade-level range expansion arising from differences in net species diversification between clades. We show that predictions of this model discriminate between weaker and stronger climatic niche conservatism, and compare these predictions with range-size patterns of marine bivalves at the species and clade (genus) level. Location: Western Pacific, eastern Pacific and western Atlantic. Methods: We decompose the latitudinal and thermal distribution of genera into within-species and among-species components. We use a neutral model in which species range expansion does not vary with latitude and descendants originate within the ranges of their ancestors (model with spatial dependency) or where descendants originate independently of ancestral ranges (model without spatial dependency). Result: In accord with model predictions: (1) genus latitudinal range size is weakly related to the latitudinal range sizes of congeneric species, but strongly depends on per-genus species richness; (2) among-species latitudinal distances correlate positively with per-genus species richness; and (3) genus latitudinal and thermal range sizes increase towards higher latitudes because genera that are species rich anywhere within their range increase in proportion towards higher latitudes. Main conclusions: Application of the neutral probabilistic model to marine bivalves shows that tropical niche conservatism is only moderately strong, and that species diversification plays a significant role in range expansion of bivalve genera to new latitudes and climates, even when thermal range sizes and limits of congeneric species show significant correlations, and are thus conserved to some degree. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Biogeography; geographic range; macroecology; niche breadth; niche conservatism hypothesis; out-of-the-tropics hypothesis; palaeobiology; Rapoport's rule; species–genus ratio,biogeography; ecological modeling; hypothesis testing; latitudinal gradient; macroecology; niche breadth; paleobiology; range expansion; range size; Rapoport Rule; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (West); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Pacific Ocean (West); Bivalvia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996655444,,FALSE,?

Mountain uplifts are known to catalyse species radiation but their impact on evolutionarily stable taxa such as many trees remains little understood. The oak Quercus aquifolioides is endemic to yet widely distributed across the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in the Eastern Himalayas. Here, we investigate how the region's Neogene and Quaternary history has driven the species' past population dynamics and the resulting extant patterns of intraspecific diversity. Location: Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot in SW China. Methods: We sampled 58 populations throughout the species range and genotyped a total of 959 individuals at four chloroplast DNA fragments and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. Phylogenetic reconstructions, molecular dating techniques and ancestral area reconstructions were used in combination with population genetic statistics to infer the biogeographical history of Q. aquifolioides. The phylogeographical study was complemented by a survey of fossil records and a niche modelling exercise. Results: Combined molecular and fossil evidence indicates that Q. aquifolioides descended during the late Miocene from the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into Tibet and the western Sichuan Plateau, and from there, into the area of highest endemism in the Hengduan Mountains sensu lato. Great apparent population stability and a haplotype ‘radiation’ in this area contrasted with marked extinction–recolonization dynamics and reduced population diversity in Tibet. We found evidence for extremely limited seed gene flow but extensive pollen gene flow (global FST: cpDNA = 0.98, nSSR = 0.07) with signals of asymmetric pollen dispersal from the Hengduan Mountains into Tibet. Main conclusion: Our results provide insights of unprecedented detail into the ancient biogeographical history of the Hengduanshan Biodiversity Hotspot, suggesting that past environmental changes in the region may have catalysed radiative diversifications within species much in the same way as among species. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",biodiversity hotspot; gene flow; genetic differentiation; Hengduan Mountains; intraspecific radiation; Neogene; orogeny; Quercus aquifolioides; Tibet,biodiversity; chloroplast; divergence; endemism; fossil record; gene flow; genetic differentiation; intraspecific variation; Miocene; orogeny; phylogeography; pollen; population dynamics; shrub; China; Hengduan Mountains; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Sichuan; Quercus aquifolioides,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979986545,,TRUE,?

Their early expansion from their original niches into Europe is intrinsically related to discussions of climate change, origins of domesticated plants and animals, the spread of agriculture and infectious diseases. The Holocene fossil records of the dispersal of three storage pest species, Sitophilus granarius, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, and Tribolium castaneum, the housefly, Musca domestica, and the human flea, Pulex irritans from 221 sites have been mapped ranging from the Near East to Europe and from the Neolithic to the post medieval period. The importance of human induced change as a driver for the spread of synanthropic faunas and the potential for the spread of disease during this process are discussed. The results show links between mobility of farming groups and distribution of synanthropic insect species and produce a roadmap for the different cultural periods of the Late Holocene based on dispersal of these synanthropic insects. During the Neolithic, the first wave of insect introductions shows the northern European frontiers of storage of cereals, introduction of domestic animals and pastoralism and exchange. Pest introductions, linked with the itinerary of the Roman army, reached the most northerly parts of the Empire. During the medieval period, the insect records indicate further expansion and changes which parallel the spread of epidemic diseases like Plague. Understanding the timing and the rates of change of synanthropic insects provides key information about the development of the homogenised and highly anthropogenic environments in which we live today. © 2016 The Authors",Biogeography; Disease; Europe; Fossil insects; Holocene; Human impact; Pests,Animals; Diseases; Food storage; Biogeography; Europe; Fossil insects; Holocenes; Human impact; Pests; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; biogeography; climate change; disease spread; dispersal; fossil record; Holocene; infectious disease; insect; Medieval; niche; pastoralism; pest species; range expansion; Europe; Animalia; Hexapoda; Musca domestica; Oryzaephilus surinamensis; Pulex irritans; Sitophilus granarius; Tribolium castaneum,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002340224,,TRUE,?

We explore this assumption for the Holocene in eastern continental Asia (China, Mongolia). Boosted regression trees (BRT) between fossil pollen taxa percentages (Abies, Artemisia, Betula, Chenopodiaceae, Cyperaceae, Ephedra, Picea, Pinus, Poaceae and Quercus) and climate model outputs of mean annual precipitation (Pann) and mean temperature of the warmest month (Mtwa) for 9 and 6 ka (ka = thousand years before present) were set up and results compared to those obtained from relating modern pollen to modern climate. Overall, our results reveal only slight temporal differences in the pollen–climate relationships. Our analyses suggest that the importance of Pann compared with Mtwa for taxa distribution is higher today than it was at 6 ka and 9 ka. In particular, the relevance of Pann for Picea and Pinus increases and has become the main determinant. This change in the climate–tree pollen relationship parallels a widespread tree pollen decrease in north-central China and the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We assume that this is at least partly related to vegetation–climate disequilibrium originating from human impact. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration may have permitted the expansion of moisture-loving herb taxa (Cyperaceae and Poaceae) during the late Holocene into arid/semi-arid areas. We furthermore find that the pollen–climate relationship between north-central China and the eastern Tibetan Plateau is generally similar, but that regional differences are larger than temporal differences. In summary, vegetation–climate relationships in China are generally stable in space and time, and pollen-based climate reconstructions can be applied to the Holocene. Regional differences imply the calibration-set should be restricted spatially. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Boosted regression trees; China; Holocene; Niche stability; Pollen-climate relationship; Uniformitarianism,Climate models; Forestry; Vegetation; Boosted regression trees; China; Holocenes; Pollen-climate relationship; Uniformitarianism; Climate change; air temperature; arid region; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; climate change; coniferous tree; future prospect; Holocene; niche partitioning; paleobotany; pollen; precipitation (climatology); reconstruction; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Mongolia; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Abies; Amaranthaceae; Artemisia; Betula; Cyperaceae; Ephedra; Picea; Poaceae; Quercus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002152607,,TRUE,?

These countries generally have high levels of fossil-fuel technology lock-in and low capacities to change, making the shift to sustainable energy difficult.

This article assesses the potential to use internationally supported Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) to develop solar energy in Tanzania and contribute to transformational change of the electricity supply system. By assessing the cultural legitimacy of NAMAs among key stakeholders in the solar energy sector, we analyse the conditions for successful uptake of the concept in (1) national political thought and institutional frameworks and (2) the solar energy niche. Interview data are analysed from a multi-level perspective on transition, focusing on its cultural dimension. Several framings undermining legitimacy are articulated, such as attaching low-actor credibility to responsible agencies and the concept’s poor fit with political priorities. Actors that discern opportunities for NAMAs could, however, draw on a framing of high commensurability between experienced social needs and opportunities to use NAMAs to address them through climate-compatible development.

We examined trace fossils, the record of the activities of past life, to understand how animals diversify both behaviourally and ecologically when colonizing new habitats. The faunal invasion of land was preceded by excursions of benthic animals into very shallow, marginal marine environments during the latest Ediacaran period and culminated in widespread colonization of non-marine niches by the end of the Carboniferous period. Trace fossil evidence for the colonization of new environments shows repeated early burst patterns of maximal ichnodisparity (the degree of difference among basic trace fossil architectural designs), ecospace occupation and level of ecosystem engineering prior to maximal ichnodiversity. Similarities across different environments in the types of behavioural programme employed (as represented by different trace fossils), modes of life present and the ways in which animals impacted their environments suggest constraints on behavioural and ecological diversification. The early burst patterns have the hallmark of novelty events. The underlying drivers of these events were probably the extrinsic limitation of available ecospace and intrinsic controls of genomic and developmental plasticity that enabled trace-maker morphological and behavioural novelty. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This was used to calibrate a palaeo-species distribution model, and analyse variable importance at continental and local scales. Location: Europe and Irano-Turanian region (20° N to 70° N, 10° W to 70° E). Methods: We used archaeological records and palaeoclimatic and topographic predictors to calibrate a model based on an ensemble of generalized linear models fitted with different combinations of predictors and weighted background data. Area under the curve scores computed by leave-one-out were used to assess variable importance at the continental scale, while local regression combined with recursive partition trees was used to assess variable importance at the local scale. Results: Annual rainfall and winter temperatures were the most important predictors at the continental scale, while topography and summer rainfall defined habitat suitability at the local scale. The highest habitat suitability scores were observed along the Mediterranean coastlines. Mountain ranges and continental plains showed low habitat suitability values. Main conclusions: The model results confirmed that abiotic drivers played an important role in shaping Neanderthals distribution during the Last Interglacial.

In characteristic of continental islands is that the geographic connections between these islands, which are currently distinguished by seaways, have experienced fluctuations caused by sea-level changes due to climate oscillations during the Quaternary. Plant populations on the islands have migrated between these islands via the exposed seafloors or been isolated. Here, we examined the demographic history of a temperate shrub, Rhododendron weyrichii, which is distributed in the southwestern parts of the Japanese archipelago and on an island of South Korea, using statistical phylogeographic approaches based on the DNA sequences of two chloroplast and eight nuclear loci in samples analyzed from 18 populations on eight continental islands, and palaeodistribution modeling. Time estimates for four island populations indicate that the durations of vicariance history are different between these populations, and these events have continued since the last glacial or may have predated the last glacial. The constancy or expansion of population sizes on the Japanese islands, and in contrast a bottleneck in population size on the Korean island Jeju, suggests that these islands may have provided different conditions for sustaining populations. The result of palaeodistribution modeling indicates that the longitudinal range of the species as a whole has not changed greatly since the last glacial maximum. These results indicate that exposed seafloors during the glacial period formed both effective and ineffective migration corridors. These findings may shed light on the effects of seafloor exposure on the migration of plants distributed across continental islands. © 2016 The Authors.

Conversely, the palaeorecord shows strong sensitivity of species abundances and distributions to past climate changes, but few clear instances of extinctions attributable to rising temperatures. However, few studies have incorporated palaeoecological data into projections of future distributions. Here we project changes in abundance and conservation status under a climate warming scenario for 187 European and North American plant taxa using niche-based models calibrated against taxa-climate relationships for the past 21,000 years. We find that incorporating long-term data into niche-based models increases the magnitude of projected future changes for plant abundances and community turnover. The larger projected changes in abundances and community turnover translate into different, and often more threatened, projected IUCN conservation status for declining tree taxa, compared with traditional approaches. An average of 18.4% (North America) and 15.5% (Europe) of taxa switch IUCN categories when compared with single-time model results. When taxa categorized as ' Least Concern' are excluded, the palaeo-calibrated models increase, on average, the conservation threat status of 33.2% and 56.8% of taxa. Notably, however, few models predict total disappearance of taxa, suggesting resilience for these taxa, if climate were the only extinction driver.

They represent the core of species ranges. Their distribution and extent, coupled with dispersal and colonization, shape the realized range of species. In this study, we quantified the roles of survival within NSAs and post-glacial dispersal in determining the current distribution of two groups of alpine butterflies (two taxa in the Erebia tyndarus species complex; three taxa in the Parnassius apollo–P. phoebus species complex). Location: Holarctic. Methods: NSAs were identified for each taxon by combining current and past potential distributions models, estimated using different modelling techniques and general circulation models. We then (1) assessed the distributional bias towards NSAs by comparing actual occurrence records with randomized occupancies of the current potential range and (2) quantified post-glacial dispersal by examining the distribution of distances from each occurrence record to the nearest NSA. Results: In almost all taxa, realized distributions are biased towards NSAs. However, while Erebia's present range is strongly dominated by NSAs, some populations of Parnassius are found very far from NSAs, suggesting more effective colonization of the available geographical space. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the relative roles of survival within NSAs and post-glacial dispersal in shaping the ranges of different alpine butterflies during the Holocene. Results suggest that Erebia was unable to disperse far from NSAs, thus experiencing increasing range fragmentation. Parnassius populations, on the other hand, coupled local survival with northward dispersal. As NSAs allowed the long-term survival of the species, acting as sources for recolonization, and tend to preserve most of each species’ genetic diversity, identifying NSAs and understanding their importance in determining the current distribution of species represents a pivotal task for the conservation of biological diversity. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",alpine species; butterflies; climate change; Erebia; hindcasting; interglacial refugia; niche stability areas; Parnassius; species distribution modelling; species–climate equilibrium,alpine environment; butterfly; climate conditions; colonization; hindcasting; Holarctic Region; niche partitioning; Postglacial; range expansion; refugium; survival; zoogeography; Erebia; Erebia tyndarus; Papilionoidea; Parnassius; Parnassius phoebus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994187936,,TRUE,

BP, documents human–environment interaction and the local subsistence economy soon after the initiation of food production in the region. This economy supported a sizeable community that occupied a kilometer stretch of floodplain along the Nandasha River. The research explores plant domestication, the extent to which the Yuezhuang population had developed a food production niche, and, to a lesser extent, the development of agriculture in the lower Yellow River valley. In order to do so, charred seeds from a variety of plant taxa were recovered by flotation of sediment from pits and cultural strata. Just over 30% of the seed assemblage is rice (Oryza sativa), broomcorn/common millet (Panicum miliaceum), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica subsp. italica). The status of several other plants such as soybean (Glycine max subsp. max or G. max subsp. soja), perilla (Perilla sp.), and chenopod (Chenopodium sp.) that are also cultivated in East Asia is also assessed. Most of the plant taxa are from open, sunlit, and anthropogenic, disrupted habitats. Diverse grasses similar to those found at later sites indicate that the farming niche documented at the late Neolithic Longshan Culture in Shandong Province was being established by 8000–7700 cal.

However, little is known about the role of vegetation in cities where biogenic CO2 uptake is not limited to a 2–8 months growing season. This study used the eddy covariance technique to quantify the atmospheric CO2 fluxes over a period of 12 months in a residential area in subtropical Auckland, New Zealand, where the vegetation cover (surface cover fraction: 47%) is dominated by evergreen vegetation. Radiocarbon isotope measurements of CO2 were conducted at three different times of the day (06:00–09:00, 12:00–15:00, 01:00–04:00) for four consecutive weekdays in summer and winter to differentiate anthropogenic sources of CO2 (fossil fuel combustion) from biogenic sources (ecosystem respiration, combustion of biofuel/biomass). The results reveal previously unreported patterns for CO2 fluxes, with no seasonal variability and negative (net uptake) CO2 midday fluxes throughout the year, demonstrating photosynthetic uptake by the evergreen vegetation all year-round. The winter radiocarbon measurements showed that 85% of the CO2 during the morning rush hour was attributed to fossil fuel emissions, when wind was from residential areas. However, for all other time periods radiocarbon measurements showed that fossil fuel combustion was not a large source of CO2, suggesting that biogenic processes likely dominate CO2 fluxes at this residential site. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of vegetation in residential areas to mitigate local CO2 emissions, particularly in cities with a climate that allows evergreen vegetation to maintain high photosynthetic rates over winter. As urban areas grow, urban planners need to consider the role of urban greenspace to mitigate urban CO2 emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Biogenic CO2; Carbon dioxide fluxes; Eddy covariance; Radiocarbon; Source partitioning; Vegetation,Carbon; Combustion; Ecosystems; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Housing; Vegetation; Biogenic CO2; Carbon dioxide flux; Eddy covariance; Radiocarbon; Source partitioning; Carbon dioxide; carbon 14; carbon dioxide; anthropogenic source; biogenic emission; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; eddy covariance; fossil fuel; greenspace; growing season; niche partitioning; radiometric method; residential location; subtropical region; temperate environment; temporal variation; vegetation cover; air quality; Article; Eddy covariance; evergreen; growing season; pastureland; photosynthetic rate; priority journal; residential area; tropics; vegetation; Auckland; New Zealand; North Island,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983537844,,FALSE,

(Gentianaceae). Our study depicts the origin and dispersal routes of this alpine genus, and the role of the uplift of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) and past climate changes as triggers for its diversification. Location: Tibeto-Himalayan region and world-wide mountain habitats. Methods: Our sampling represents more than 50% of the extant Gentiana species, including all sections across their entire geographical ranges. We investigated the evolutionary history of Gentiana using phylogenetic reconstructions (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) of ITS, atpB–rbcL and trnL–trnF sequences, as well as molecular dating with beast. We tested two approaches of ancestral area reconstructions (DEC, DIVA) in BioGeoBEARS and investigated diversification rates using BAMM. Results: The common ancestor of Gentiana and subtribe Gentianinae lived in the QTP region at around 34 (25–45) million years ago (Ma), and 40 (29–52) Ma respectively. From the surroundings of the QTP, Gentiana lineages dispersed to eastern China, Taiwan, Europe, North and South America, Australia and New Guinea, from mid-Miocene onward (c. 15 Ma–present), with only one older dispersal event to Europe (c. 37–21 Ma). Diversification rates gradually increased over time, and two switches of diversification rates were identified in Gentianinae (c. 7 Ma, simultaneously in the Pneumonanthe/Cruciata lineage and in Tripterospermum). Main conclusions: Gentiana existed in the QTP region throughout most of its uplift history following the India-Asia collision. This region acted as the primary source area for dispersals to many areas of the world. Because steady increase in diversification rates coincides with the extension of the QTP, we argue that the museum theory rather than the explosive radiation theory prevails for gentians in this region, although rare shifts of diversification rates are associated with niche shifts across the alpine/subalpine ecotone. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Alpine flora; biogeography; diversification rates; Gentiana; molecular dating; molecular phylogeny; Qinghai–Tibet Plateau,alpine environment; ancestry; biogeography; climate variation; dating method; dicotyledon; divergence; ecotone; evolutionary biology; Miocene; niche partitioning; paleoclimate; phylogenetics; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Europe; New Guinea; North America; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; South America; Taiwan; Gentiana; Gentianaceae; Gentianinae; Tripterospermum,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979521085,,FALSE,

However, little is known about how increasing climate variance may affect ecosystem productivity. Forest ecosystems may be particularly susceptible to this problem considering the complex organizational structure of specialized species niche adaptations. Forest decline is often attributable to multiple stressors including prolonged heat, wildfire and insect outbreaks. These disturbances, often categorized as megadisturbances, can push temperate forests beyond sustainability thresholds. Absent from much of the contemporary forest health literature, however, is the discussion of excessive precipitation that may affect other disturbances synergistically or that might represent a principal stressor. Here, specific points of evidence are provided including historic climatology, variance predictions from global change modeling, Midwestern paleo climate data, local climate influences on net ecosystem exchange and productivity, and pathogen influences on oak mortality. Data sources reveal potential trends, deserving further investigation, indicating that the western edge of the Eastern Deciduous forest may be impacted by ongoing increased precipitation, precipitation variance and excessive wetness. Data presented, in conjunction with recent regional forest health concerns, suggest that climate variance including drought and excessive wetness should be equally considered for forest ecosystem resilience against increasingly dynamic climate.

Ecological niche models are used to assess niche overlap in model projections for key testudine ecotypes and families. An ordination framework is applied to quantify metrics of niche change (stability, expansion, and unfilling) between the Maastrichtian and present day. Results indicate that niche stability over evolutionary timescales varies between testudine clades. Groups that originated in the Early Cretaceous show climatic niche stability, whereas those diversifying towards the end of the Cretaceous display larger niche expansion towards the modern. Temperature is the dominant driver of modern and past distributions, whereas precipitation is important for freshwater turtle ranges. Our findings demonstrate that testudines were able to occupy warmer climates than present day in the geological record.

This pattern was observed for the facultative halophytes Artemisia laciniata and A. rupestris having distribution gaps of about 2500 km in Eastern Europe. To infer possible reasons for the gap, we assembled data on saline soil distribution, ranges of selected halophytes and seven closely related Artemisia species, their climate space occupancy, dominance in the vegetation, as well paleovegetation data, and related them to the distribution gap. Lack of saline soils was not responsible for the distribution gaps of the two Artemisia species, but may be range limiting for other Artemisia species. The related halophytic Artemisia species have complementary and mutually exclusive ranges to the two target species, and thus fill the distribution gap as well as the gap in the climate space. According to the climate space, some species should be more widespread than observed. Interspecific competition among close relatives most likely is the reason for the distribution gap, because many studied species are vegetation dominants and are thus competitive over large geographical areas. These data are in accordance with models of vegetation development since the Last Glacial Maximum. Filled ecological niches by congeners may have impeded migration of the species to saline soils during climate change, and increased competition with non-halophytes. This may have been the ultimate reason for large scale extinction of intermediate populations in Eastern Europe. Particular life history traits of the species, e.g. the fast cessation of reproduction with increasing competitive stress, may have played a pivotal role in this process. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH",Asteraceae; Climate change; Climate space; Competition; Extinction; Saline soils,climate change; extinction; halophyte; herb; interspecific competition; Last Glacial; Last Glacial Maximum; life history trait; paleoclimate; paleoecology; reproduction; saline soil; vegetation cover; Eastern Europe; Artemisia; Artemisia laciniata; Artemisia rupestris; Asteraceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989837844,,TRUE,?

Here we combine population genetics with species distribution modelling to assess patterns and causes of extinction or persistence in two cold-adapted species, Salix hastata and Juncus balticus, which survived post-glacial retractions in calcareous fens of the Iberian Peninsula. In both species, we detected extremely-low genetic diversity and clonal strategies in red-listed populations of the most marginal region (Cantabrian Range), but high genetic diversity linked with sexual reproduction in populations from a less marginal region of the rear edge (Pyrenees). Genetic patterns were partially explained by past and present species´ climatic niches, more remarkably in the arctic-alpine S. hastata than in the boreo-atlantic J. balticus, suggesting different biogeographic history but similar sensitivity to global change. Our results show different magnitudes of extinction debt in regional populations that have survived in mountain refugia since the Last Glacial Maximum. Functional extinction of the most marginal populations can be explained by postglacial climate change and the historical decline of mire habitats. In contrast with the current trend of predicting future effects of climate change, we highlight that glacial relict populations might be currently going into extinction in climatically marginal regions. These populations can provide valuable information about the processes involved in species extinctions, improving our capacity to anticipate the effect of global change across regions and habitats. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Clonality; Extinction debt; Genetic drift; Paleoclimate; Refugia; Relict populations,biogeography; climate change; conservation status; extinction risk; genetic drift; Last Glacial Maximum; mire; paleoclimate; persistence; population decline; population distribution; population genetics; relict species; sexual reproduction; shrub; species conservation; Cantabrian Mountains; Iberian Peninsula; Pyrenees; Spain; Juncus balticus; Salix hastata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979234547,,TRUE,

Various mechanisms such as in situ adaptive divergence, speciation following immigration or allopatric diversification in complex landscapes have been proposed to account for the exceptional diversity found in a particular clade in a montane setting. We investigated macroevolutionary patterns to test these different hypotheses in the continental radiation of a Sino-Himalayan bird group, the parrotbills (Paradoxornithidae). Location: Sino-Himalayan region, Indo-Burma. Methods: We used phylogenetic comparative methods based on a multilocus, time-calibrated phylogeny to reconstruct patterns of lineage diversification, biogeographical history, morphological evolution as well as of climate niche history using ecological niche modelling. Results: The radiation of parrotbills started c. 12 Ma, diversifying at an apparent constant rate over time. The biogeographical history appears to be complex, within-region speciation in mountains was restricted to China. Size evolution was concentrated in the early phase of parrotbill radiation, whereas morphological shape evolution did not differ from Brownian motion. We found no indication for niche conservatism, with climate niche evolution occurring throughout the radiation of parrotbills. Conclusions: Parrotbills diversified within a time span of increased regional orogenesis and associated strong climate change. While the south-west and central Chinese mountains were revealed to be a species pump, with in situ allopatric diversification triggered by complex topography and high habitat turnover, the diversity in the Himalayas was chiefly the result of immigration. Evidence for continuous ecological specialization and for the absence of climate niche conservatism could be interpreted as the consequence of ongoing climate- and habitat-induced ecological opportunities. The radiation of parrotbills demonstrates the influence of multiple drivers of diversification in a single group due to the dynamic geological and palaeoclimatic history of the Sino-Himalayan region and illustrates the complex nature of continental radiations. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",biogeographical history; climate niche evolution; continental radiation; diversification; ecological niche modelling; ecological opportunity; morphological evolution; parrotbills; Passeriformes; Sino-Himalayan region,adaptive radiation; allopatry; biogeography; cladistics; divergence; ecological modeling; evolutionary biology; historical ecology; immigration; morphology; niche; passerine; phylogeny; specialization; speciation (biology); China; Himalayas; Indo-Burma; Aves; Passeriformes,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960917613,,TRUE,

The fossil record suggests a sudden adaptive radiation of placentals immediately after the event, but several recent quantitative analyses have reconstructed no significant increase in either clade origination rates or rates of character evolution in the Palaeocene. Here we use stochastic methods to date a recent phylogenetic analysis of Cretaceous and Palaeocene mammals and show that Placentalia likely originated in the Late Cretaceous, but that most intraordinal diversification occurred during the earliest Palaeocene. This analysis reconstructs fewer than 10 placental mammal lineages crossing the K-Pg boundary. Moreover,we showthat rates of morphological evolution in the 5 Myr interval immediately after the K-Pg mass extinction are three times higher than background rates during the Cretaceous. These results suggest that the K-Pg mass extinction had a marked impact on placental mammal diversification, supporting the view that an evolutionary radiation occurred as placental lineages invaded new ecological niches during the Early Palaeocene. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

When forming conservation strategies, correlative species distribution models are often created to assess risks for individual species. These models are based on the assumption of climatic equilibrium, such that the modern range is representative of the full range of conditions under which species could thrive. However, the palaeo-ecological record illustrates examples of disequilibrium in species today, and recent studies suggest that many species could occur in much broader climatic settings than previously thought. Montane ecosystems are thought to be at disproportionate risk due to temperature sensitivity and restricted geographical ranges. However, in the Afrotropics the palaeo-ecological record shows that montane forest taxa expanded into the lowlands numerous times, suggesting a possible tolerance to warm temperatures. Location: Africa. Methods: We integrate palaeo-ecological and palaeo-climatic data in order to compare climate conditions in which species are currently found with those in the past. We use species distribution models to construct potential modern ranges for Afromontane species based on modern distributions and distributions in the palaeo-ecological record in order to evaluate the equilibrium of species ranges. Results: We show that many Afromontane trees have occupied warmer climates in the past, which suggests that the current low-elevation boundaries are not set by climate. Interestingly, the species with the largest disequilibrium between palaeo- and modern distributions are those whose modern distributions show the least temperature sensitivity. Mapping of species potential ranges based on modern and palaeo- distributions clearly shows that suitable climate conditions exist today in the lowlands for less temperature-sensitive species. Main conclusions: These results imply that the current range of these forest trees does not necessarily inform risk from climatic change, and that human land use may be the major pressure for many species in the future. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Africa; Afromontane; Climatic niche; Global environmental change; Montane ecosystems; Palaeo-climate; Palaeo-ecology; Tropical biogeography; Tropical ecology,environmental change; montane forest; niche; paleoclimate; paleoecology; range expansion; temperature effect; tropical forest; Africa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962840560,,TRUE,

Although nations with active forest sectors could be subject to unique factors that discourage the increased use of wood for energy, lessons learned from nations with well-developed woody biomass energy sectors could be used to assist in the development of nascent woody biomass energy sectors elsewhere. Here, energy sector data and relevant policies from Austria, Finland, Germany and Sweden (OECD countries with well-developed, modern wood energy sectors) are compared with those from Australia and Canada (OECD countries with less mature wood energy sectors). The energy sectors of the EU nations considered in this analysis exhibit striking differences with Australia and Canada. Of particular interest are critical differences in the supply of domestic primary energy, energy used per unit GDP, sovereign energy security, the mix of energy sources utilised, the economic viability of non-hydro renewables and the extent to which economies depend on fossil fuels. The policies affecting renewable energy sector development, including woody biomass availability and GHG reduction targets, also differ significantly. Adoption of new technologies with niche applications, leveraged with knowledge from the best practices and experience of countries with well-established bioenergy supply chains, represent an opportunity to set strong foundations for bioenergy production in countries with immature bioenergy sectors. Based on this analysis, it appears prima facie that the goal of reducing GHG emissions is only one of many factors that determine how much emphasis individual nations place on developing non-hydro renewable energy sectors (including woody biomass). The development of a woody biomass energy sector may be driven most strongly by regional issues, such as the need for less expensive waste disposal, cost-effective substitutions for fossil fuels, local economic development and energy resilience. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, these often poorly reflect pre-European distributions, particularly in areas where biodiversity declines were rapid and occurred soon after European arrival. Here we analyse two late Holocene mammalian assemblages from Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia, and reconstruct the pre-European terrestrial non-volant mammal fauna.

The relationship of past and current climate with phylogenetic assemblage structure helps us to understand this question. Studies of angiosperm tree diversity in North America have already suggested effects of current water-energy balance and tropical niche conservatism. However, the role of glacial-interglacial climate variability remains to be determined, and little is known about any of these relationships for gymnosperms. Moreover, phylogenetic endemism, the concentration of unique lineages in restricted ranges, may also be related to glacial-interglacial climate variability and needs more attention. We used a refined phylogeny of both angiosperms and gymnosperms to map phylogenetic diversity, clustering and endemism of North American trees in 100-km grid cells, and climate change velocity since Last Glacial Maximum together with postglacial accessibility to recolonization to quantify glacial-interglacial climate variability. We found: (1) Current climate is the dominant factor explaining the overall patterns, with more clustered angiosperm assemblages toward lower temperature, consistent with tropical niche conservatism. (2) Long-term climate stability is associated with higher angiosperm endemism, while higher postglacial accessibility is linked to to more phylogenetic clustering and endemism in gymnosperms. (3) Factors linked to glacial-interglacial climate change have stronger effects on gymnosperms than on angiosperms. These results suggest that paleoclimate legacies supplement current climate in shaping phylogenetic patterns in North American trees, and especially so for gymnosperms. © 2016 The Authors.",Gymnosperm; Net Relatedness Index; Paleoclimate; Phylogenetic diversity; Phylogenetic endemism; Tropical niche conservatism,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963546146,,TRUE,?

Based on past and present predicted species distributions, we assessed (1) whether climatic conditions may have supported species survival in the same area over the studied period, (2) the effect of ecological niche specialization on species-specific responses, and (3) the persistence of current populations in areas that were more climatically stable over time. Location: Western Ghats, Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, India. Methods: We assessed species' current bioclimatic preferences based on their occurrence data using Maxent distribution modelling. The models were projected onto past climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Last Interglacial (LIG) to assess the extent of changes in species' predicted distributions through time. Further, we tested whether species' current occurrences were located non-randomly in pixels predicted to have been suitable in the past. Finally, we characterized species-specific responses in relation to plausible biogeographical scenarios. Results: We identified three distinct scenarios of species' responses to past climate changes - stability, contraction and shift - depending on their bioclimatic preferences. For high-elevation species, the cool, dry LGM was less restrictive than for medium-elevation and northern lowland species. Southernmost species requiring minimal seasonality were restricted by higher LIG seasonality, and only predicted to have been present in Sri Lanka at that time. Barring these southernmost narrow endemics, past suitable habitat, within which observed current occurrences are located, were predicted for most species. Main conclusions: Palaeoclimate modelling reveals the likely local persistence of most Western Ghats endemics over the last 150 kyr, a relatively recent period in this Paleogene refugium. The large spectrum of bioclimatic preferences probably arose as a result of evolutionary events prior to the Quaternary.

Exceptional fossils indicate that important evolutionary novelties such as a pygostyle and a keeled sternum had already arisen in Early Cretaceous taxa, bridging much of the morphological gap between Archaeopteryx and crown birds. However, detailed features of basal bird evolution remain obscure because of both the small sample of fossil taxa previously considered and a lack of quantitative studies assessing rates of morphological evolution. Here we apply a recently available phylogenetic method and associated sensitivity tests to a large data matrix ofmorphological characters to quantify rates ofmorphological evolution in Early Cretaceous birds.Our results reveal that although rates were highly heterogeneous between different Early Cretaceous avian lineages, consistent patterns of significantly high or low rates were harder to pinpoint. Nevertheless, evidence for accelerated evolutionary rates is strongest at the point when Ornithuromorpha (the clade comprises all extant birds and descendants from their most recent common ancestors) split from Enantiornithes (a diverse clade that went extinct at the end-Cretaceous), consistent with the hypothesis that this key split opened up new niches and ultimately led to greater diversity for these two dominant clades of Mesozoic birds. © 2016 The Royal Society.

Earlier studies, focused on glacial refugia, might have overlooked genetic erosion at lower latitudes associated with warmer periods. For marine species able to colonize deeper waters, depth shifts might be important for local persistence, preventing some latitudinal shifts, analogous to elevational refugia in terrestrial habitats. In this study, we asked whether past latitudinal or depth range shifts explain extant gene pools in Saccorhiza polyschides, a large habitat structuring brown alga distributed from coastal to offshore deep reefs. Location: North-east Atlantic and western Mediterranean basin. Methods: Genetic structure and diversity were inferred using seven microsatellite loci, for 27 sites throughout the entire distributional range. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) was performed with and without information about genetic structure (sub-taxon niche structure) to predict distributions for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the warmer Mid-Holocene (MH) and the present. Results: Both ENM approaches predicted a wider potential distribution in deeper waters than is presently known, a post-glacial expansion to northern shores and the extirpation of southern edges during the warmer MH. Genetic data corroborated range dynamics, revealing three major genetic groups with current boundaries in the Bay of Biscay and the Lisbon coastal region, pinpointing ancient refugial origins. Despite extensive southern range contraction, the southernmost warmer regions are still the richest in genetic diversity, indicating long-term persistence of large populations. ENMs suggested that this could only have been possible due to stable refugia in deeper reefs. Main conclusions: The global distribution of gene pools of temperate marine forests is explained by past range shifts that structured both latitudinal glacial refugia and depth refugia during warmer periods. Deep rear edge populations play a fundamental role during periods of extreme climate, allowing persistence and retaining some of the largest genetic diversity pools of the species' distribution. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Saccorhiza polyschides; Climate change; Depth range shifts; Ecological niche modelling; Genetic diversity; Glacial refugia; Kelp forests; Marine phylogeography; North-east Atlantic; Western Mediterranean,brown alga; climate variation; ecological modeling; genetic marker; genetic structure; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; marine environment; paleobiogeography; paleoenvironment; phylogeography; reef; refugium; vertical distribution; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Bay of Biscay; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (West); Portugal; Phaeophyceae; Saccorhiza polyschides,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962509370,,TRUE,

Range-size reduction in high mountain plant species is predicted to be more pronounced for endemic species. Investigating the broad temporal spectrum of range shifts is important for the conservation of biodiversity, since learning how species responded to climate change in the past provides useful insights on how they might react to warming trends in the present and future. Using species distribution models and an ensemble forecasting approach, we explored how the distribution of Berardia subacaulis, a monospecific genus endemic of the south-west Alps, may be affected by past and future projected climate change. During the last interglacial, the habitat suitability of Berardia was lower than present and a progressive increase was observed from the last glacial maximum until now. In the future, Berardia appears to lose more than 80 % of its range, becoming endangered by 2050. Our results suggest that Berardia probably survived past warmer periods in situ, expanding its distributional range during cooler periods. The severe future range contraction predicted for Berardia reflects similar results for other endemic species.

The authors of this paper identify four main challenges to absolute reductions, including: the resource-intensive conventional template for development, macroeconomic structures and trade policies creating burden-shifting and inequality, a resource-efficiency improvements fallacy, and the dominant consumerist culture and lifestyles. The paper demonstrates the complexity of translating planetary boundaries into boundaries for resource use and targets for absolute reductions, proposing a practical approach starting with defining footprints for water, land and materials, and then proceeding to set resource boundaries. In seeking potential solutions, the paper highlights research addressing materials and product substitution, ecological fiscal reform with measures such as carbon taxation, sustainable lifestyles, design for sustainability, eco-innovation, and management of power dynamics in the production-consumption system. We then propose six domains in a research agenda for future research. These include: moving from niches and demonstration projects to broader norms; addressing reductions targets and indicators to guide policy and action; including policy design reflecting complexities such as time-lags, the resource nexus, and positive feedback loops; global resource governance; and convergence pathways between over-consuming and under-consuming societies.

However, the theory that underpins the method has never been examined in detail. Here we discuss acknowledged and implicit assumptions and assess the statistical nature and pseudo-logic of the method. We also compare the Coexistence Approach theory with the active field of species distribution modelling. We argue that the assumptions will inevitably be violated to some degree and that the method lacks any substantive means to identify or quantify these violations. The absence of a statistical framework makes the method highly vulnerable to the vagaries of statistical outliers and exotic elements. In addition, we find numerous logical inconsistencies, such as how climate shifts are quantified (the use of a ""centre value"" of a coexistence interval) and the ability to reconstruct ""extinct"" climates from modern plant distributions. Given the problems that have surfaced in species distribution modelling, accurate and precise quantitative reconstructions of palaeoclimates (or even climate shifts) using the nearest-living-relative principle and rectilinear niches (the basis of the method) will not be possible. The Coexistence Approach can be summarised as an exercise that shoehorns a plant fossil assemblage into coexistence and then assumes that this must be the climate. Given the theoretical issues and methodological issues highlighted elsewhere, we suggest that the method be discontinued and that all past reconstructions be disregarded and revisited using less fallacious methods. We outline six steps for (further) validation of available and future taxon-based methods and advocate developing (semi-quantitative) methods that prioritise robustness over precision. © Author(s) 2016.",,coexistence; fossil assemblage; fossil record; niche; outlier; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; precision; reconstruction; statistical analysis,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960911492,,TRUE,?*

Community-level models (CLMs) capitalize on species co-occurrences to fit shared environmental responses of species and communities, and therefore may result in more robust and transferable models. Here, we conduct a controlled comparison of five paired SDMs and CLMs across changing climates, using palaeoclimatic simulations and fossilpollen records of eastern North America for the past 21 000 years. Both SDMs and CLMs performed poorly when projected to time periods that are temporally distant and climatically dissimilar from those in which they were fit; however, CLMs generally outperformed SDMs in these instances, especially when models were fit with sparse calibration datasets. Additionally, CLMs did not over-fit training data, unlike SDMs. The expected emergence of novel climates presents a major forecasting challenge for all models, but CLMs may better rise to this challenge by borrowing information from co-occurring taxa. © 2016 The Authors.",Co-occurrence; Ecological niche modelling; No-analogue; Palaeoecology; Pollen; Quaternary,"biodiversity; data set; ecological modeling; emergence; environmental response; fossil record; niche; paleoclimate; paleoecology; pollen; Quaternary; North America; biodiversity; biological model; climate; climate change; fossil; North America; plant dispersal; pollen; Biodiversity; Climate; Climate Change; Fossils; Models, Biological; North America; Plant Dispersal; Pollen",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962615474,,TRUE,*

Most of the European fossil Quaternary amphibians belong to extant species, and being physiologically ectothermic animals, their current ecological niches could become a reliable inference tool to infer past environmental conditions. However, this expectation has never been properly verified. The validity and accuracy of palaeoclimatic inferences based on batrachian species ranges is tested on the Iberian Peninsula, using both palaeofaunistic and Recent distribution data, and an updated database of georeferenced species occurrences is provided. The difficulties of using current geographic information to represent the full spectrum of environmental conditions at which a species occurs are critically examined. A palaeofaunistic review of the role played by historical factors as dispersal limitations for present amphibian species ranges is presented using the available phylogeographical scenarios. Virtual hypothetical taxa can be devised by considering the distributions of several species together and relating their known joint presences with the environmental conditions in these locations. Species distribution models based on these virtual taxa provide the best advisable inferential procedure. For direct raw inferences of the mutual climatic range method, contrary to expectations, the combined taxa sets do not increase their accuracy with the number of species included. This preliminary review shows that Iberian amphibian palaeoclimatic inferences are both valid and reliable enough, a sufficient approximation to complement other techniques. The precision, however, is quite variable among taxa, reflecting the effect of non-climatic distributional constraints. © 2016, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Amphibia; Iberia; Palaeoclimatology; Palaeofaunistics; Quaternary,amphibian; dispersal; environmental conditions; fossil record; geographical distribution; paleoclimate; paleoecology; phylogeography; Quaternary; species occurrence; Iberian Peninsula; Amphibia; Animalia; Batrachia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961176179,,FALSE,?*

Here, we investigated the relationship between range shift since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and extant population genetic diversity across multiple plant species to understand variability in species responses. Location: The circumpolar Arctic and northern temperate alpine ranges. Methods: We estimated the climatic niches of 30 cold-adapted plant species using range maps coupled with species distribution models and hindcasted species suitable areas to reconstructions of the mid-Holocene and LGM climates. We computed the species-specific migration distances from the species glacial refugia to their current distribution and correlated distances to extant genetic diversity in 1295 populations. Differential responses among species were related to life-history traits. Results: We found a negative association between inferred migration distances from refugia and genetic diversities in 25 species, but only 11 had statistically significant negative slopes. The relationships between inferred distance and population genetic diversity were steeper for insect-pollinated species than wind-pollinated species, but the difference among pollination system was marginally independent from phylogenetic autocorrelation. Main conclusion: The relationships between inferred migration distances and genetic diversities in 11 species, independent from current isolation, indicate that past range shifts were associated with a genetic bottleneck effect with an average of 21% loss of genetic diversity per 1000 km-1. In contrast, the absence of relationship in many species also indicates that the response is species specific and may be modulated by plant pollination strategies or result from more complex historical contingencies than those modelled here. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Arctic plants; Climate change; Climatic niche; Last Glacial maximum; Migration; Species distribution models,alpine environment; climate variation; community response; genetic variation; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; migration; niche; paleoclimate; phylogenetics; plant community; population bottleneck; population distribution; population genetics; range expansion; reconstruction; refugium; vegetation mapping; Arctic; Hexapoda,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958122938,,TRUE,

To assess whether the modern distribution of the genus can be explained by the tropical conservatism hypothesis, we tested three predictions: (1) species from all Nothofagus subgenera coexisted under mesothermal climates during the early Eocene, (2) tolerance to microthermal climates evolved during the Eocene-Oligocene cooling from an ancestor that grew under mesothermal conditions; and (3) the climatic niche in Nothofagus is phylogenetically conserved. Location: Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea and South America. Methods: We estimated the palaeoclimate of the Early Eocene, fossil-bearing Ligorio Marquez Formation (LMF, Chile), using coexistence and leaf physiognomic analysis. We reconstructed ancestral climatic niches of Nothofagus using extant species distributions and a time-calibrated phylogeny. Finally, we used the morphological disparity index and phylogenetic generalized least squares to assess whether climatic variables follow a Brownian motion (BM) or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of evolution. Results: Our palaeoclimatic estimates suggest mesothermal conditions for the LMF, where macrofossils associated with subgenera Lophozonia and possibly Fuscospora, and fossil pollen of Brassospora and Fuscospora/Nothofagus were recorded. These results are not supported by our phylogenetic analysis, which instead suggests that the ancestor of Nothofagus lived under microthermal to marginally mesothermal conditions, with tolerance to mesothermal conditions evolving only in the subgenus Brassospora. Precipitation and temperature dimensions of the realized climatic niche fit with a gradual BM or constrained OU model of evolution. Main Conclusions: Our results suggest that the use of phylogenetic reconstruction methods based only on present distributions of extant taxa to infer ancestral climatic niches is likely to lead to erroneous results when climatic requirements of ancestors differ from their extant descendants, or when much extinction has occurred. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Eocene; Gondwana; Into the tropics; Niche modelling; Nothofagaceae; Palaeoclimate; Phylogenetic signal; Tropical conservatism hypothesis,climate conditions; coexistence; ecological modeling; Eocene; evolution; fossil record; Gondwana; humid tropics; niche; paleoclimate; phylogenetics; phylogeny; phytogeography; reconstruction; tree; Australia; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; South America; Nothofagaceae; Nothofagus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958121345,,TRUE,

Here, we investigated spatial and temporal patterns of speciation in three groups of alpine Primulaceae. Location: Mountains of the European Alpine System. Methods: We built a new phylogeny of Primulaceae including all species in three focal groups: Androsace sect. Aretia, Primula sect. Auricula and Soldanella. Combining phylogenetic information with a detailed climatic data set, we investigated patterns of range and ecological overlap between sister-species using an approach that takes phylogenetic uncertainty into account. Finally, we investigated temporal trajectories of diversification in the three focal groups. Results: We found that a large majority of sister-species pairs in the three groups are strictly allopatric and show little differences in substrate and climatic preferences, a result that was robust to phylogenetic uncertainty. While rates of diversification have remained constant in Soldanella, both Androsace sect. Aretia and Primula sect. Auricula showed decreased diversification rates in the Pleistocene compared to previous geological epochs. Main conclusions: Allopatric speciation with little niche divergence appears to have been by far the most common mode of speciation across the three groups studied. A few examples, however, suggest that ecological and polyploid speciation might also have played a role in the diversification of these three groups. Finally, extensive diversification likely occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene coinciding with the later phases of the Alpine uplift, while diversification slowed down during subsequent glacial cycles of the Pleistocene. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Alpine plants; Androsace sect.

Ecological similarities among palaeoendemics may be indicators of ancient environments. We determine the environmental ranges of the remarkable palaeoendemic plants of Tasmania to deduce whether they indicate the long-term persistence of particular environmental conditions. Location: Tasmania, Australia, a global centre of plant palaeoendemism, containing some of the world's most relictual plant lineages. Methods: Palaeoendemic clades in Tasmania were identified using a scoring system of clade age divided by the square root of the number of 10km×10km grid cells occupied globally. Total palaeoendemism scores for 1199 30″ grid cells were calculated by summing scores for individual clades, and modelled against climate, topography, geology and vegetation type using Random Forest models. Palaeoendemic and non-palaeoendemic species richness in climate space was measured. The global distribution of climates favoured by palaeoendemics was assessed. Results: Twenty-nine phylogenetically and ecologically diverse palaeoendemic clades (51 species) were identified. High levels of palaeoendemism occurred widely in western Tasmania, but the highest scoring areas were at or slightly above the tree line in relatively undisturbed vegetation. Palaeoendemism scores were strongly predicted by constantly moist climates lacking extreme temperatures, and by open vegetation types with rare or no fire. The palaeoendemics occupied a climate space that is globally rare and very different from that of non-palaeoendemics. Main conclusions: These patterns suggest the persistence since the Cretaceous of open vegetation in constantly moist areas with equable temperatures and few or no fires. This conclusion is consistent with an increasing body of fossil and phylogenetic evidence for the antiquity of open vegetation.

Knowledge about niche partitioning, feeding mode and preference among moa species is limited, hampering palaeoecological reconstruction and evaluation of the impacts of their extinction on remnant native biota, or the viability of exotic species as proposed ecological ‘surrogates’. Here we apply three-dimensional finite-element analysis to compare the biomechanical performance of skulls from five of the six moa genera, and two extant ratites, to predict the range of moa feeding behaviours relative to each other and to living relatives. Mechanical performance during biting was compared using simulations of the birds clipping twigs based on muscle reconstruction of mummified moa remains. Other simulated food acquisition strategies included lateral shaking, pullback and dorsoventral movement of the skull. We found evidence for limited overlap in biomechanical performance between the extant emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) and extinct upland moa (Megalapteryx didinus) based on similarities in mandibular stress distribution in two loading cases, but overall our findings suggest that moa species exploited their habitats in different ways, relative to both each other and extant ratites.

Decades of tested and proven technologies have led to a continuous increase in demand for fossil-based fuels. As a result, we are now finding ourselves at the threshold of a critical tipping point where environmental consequences and global climate can be irreversibly affected and hence cannot be ignored. More than ever before, our unending and rapidly growing need for energy has necessitated urgent action on efforts to examine alternative forms of energy sources that are eco-friendly, sustainable, and economical. There are several alternatives to fossil-based fuels. These include biomass, solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear options as prominent and possible sources. All these options can assist us with reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Solar energy, being one of them, has the unique potential to meet a broad gamut of current global energy demand. These include domestic applications such as solarassisted cooking, space, heating, as well as industrial processes such as drying. Solar energy utilization in several key areas such as electricity generation (photovoltaics), clean fuel production (hydrogen), environmental remediation (photocatalytic degradation of pollutants), and reduction of greenhouse gases (CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals) is also of great interest. A key challenge that must be addressed to boost commercialization of solar energy technologies, and common to these applications, is material properties and solar energy utilization efficiency. To realize large-scale and efficient solar energy utilization, application-based materials with a unique combination of properties have to be developed. The material has to absorb visible light and be cost competitive, composed of earth-abundant elements, and nontoxic, all at the same time. This chapter consists of ten sections. The first introduction section consists of a detailed discussion on the importance of energy in human activity, the effects of fossil fuels on climate and human lifestyle, and materials that meet many of the above criteria. The second section provides a short and critical comparison of solar energy with other alternatives. The third section provides a quick review of the basic concepts of solar energy. The commonly employed toolkits used in the characterization of materials for solar energy conversion are discussed in section ""Toolkit for Characterization of Photoactive Materials (PMs)."". Some of these tools can be used to evaluate specific optical, electronic, and catalytic properties of materials. Section five discusses the main categories of materials that are either commercialized or under development. The challenges to developing new materials for solar energy conversion are addressed in section ""Materials for Solar Energy Utilization"". Section ""Integrating Tested Concepts of Solar Energy Utilization to Produce Fuels in an Effective Way"" outlines some of the main strategies to test the promising materials before a large-scale commercialization attempt is initiated. Section ""Commercial Ventures"" profiles companies and institutions that are engaged in efforts to evaluate, improve, and commercialize solar energy technologies. This segment provides information about the product from a few representative companies around the world and their niche in the commercial market. Section ""Future Work"" provides a general outlook into the trend in solar energy utilization, commercialization, and its future. Finally, section ""Conclusion"" provides the authors' concluding perspective about the solar energy as a pathway for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.

High temperature trends in the Himalaya suggest a treeline advance to higher elevations; it is largely unknown, however, how broaderscale climate inputs interact with local-scale factors and processes to govern treeline response patterns. This paper reviews and synthesizes the current state of knowledge regarding sensitivity and response of Himalayan treelines to climate warming, based on extensive field observations, published results in the widely scattered literature and novel data from ongoing research of the present authors. Palaeoecological studies indicate that the position of Himalayan treeline ecotones has been sensitive to Holocene climate change. After the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, treelines advanced in elevation to a position several hundred metres higher than today under warm-humid conditions and reached uppermost limits in the early Holocene. Decreasing temperatures below early and mid-Holocene levels induced a downward shift of treelines after c. 5.0 kyr BP. The decline of subalpine forests and treeline elevation in the more recent millennia was coincident with weakening monsoonal influence and increasing anthropogenic interferences. To assess current treeline dynamics, treeline type, treeline form, seed-based regeneration and growth patterns are evaluated as sensitivity indicators. Anthropogenic treelines are predominant in the Himalaya; upslope movement of these treelines is related to the effects of land-use change. Near-natural treelines, rare nowadays, are usually developed as krummholz treelines which are relatively unresponsive. Strong competition within the krummholz belt and dense dwarf scrub heaths further upslope largely prevents the upward migration of tree species and retards treeline advance to higher elevation. However, intense recruitment of treeline trees within the treeline ecotone and beyond indicates beneficial preconditions for future treeline ascent. Growth patterns of treeline trees are particularly sensitive to higher winter and pre-monsoon temperatures, suggesting that moisture supply in the pre-monsoon season might be an effective control of future treeline dynamics. Modelled upslope range expansions of treeline trees point to potentially favourable bioclimatic conditions for an upward shift of treelines. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Holocene; Monsoon; Niche modelling; Recruitment; Seedling; Soil moisture; Soil temperature; Tree radial growth; Treeline advance; Treeline form; Treeline type,Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Dynamics; Growth rate; Land use; Moisture; Reforestation; Soil moisture; Holocenes; Monsoon; Radial growth; Recruitment; Seedling; Soil temperature; Treeline; Forestry,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017048864,,FALSE,?

We summarize themes in and across 15 symposia using narrative analysis and word clouds, which we complement with recent publication trends and 'research fronts'. We find that biogeography is still strongly defined by core sub-disciplines that reflect its origins in botanical, zoological (particularly bird and mammal), and geographic (e.g., island, montane) studies of the 1800s. That core is being enriched by large datasets (e.g. of environmental variables, 'omics', species' occurrences, traits) and new techniques (e.g., advances in genetics, remote sensing, modeling) that promote studies with increasing detail and at increasing scales; disciplinary breadth is being diversified (e.g., by developments in paleobiogeography and microbiology) and integrated through the transfer of approaches and sharing of theory (e.g., spatial modeling and phylogenetics in evolutionary-ecological contexts). Yet some subdisciplines remain on the fringe (e.g., marine biogeography, deep-time paleobiogeography), new horizons and new theory may be overshadowed by popular techniques (e.g., species distribution modelling), and hypotheses, data, and analyses may each be wanting. Trends in publication suggest a shift away from traditional biogeography journals to multidisciplinary or open access journals. Thus, there are currently many opportunities and challenges as biogeography increasingly addresses human impacts on, and stewardship of, the planet (e.g., Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). As in the past, biogeographers doubtless will continue to be engaged by new data and methods in exploring the nexus between biology and geography for decades into the future. But golden ages come and go, and they need not touch every domain in a discipline nor affect subdisciplines at the same time; moreover, what appears to be a Golden Age may sometimes have an undesirable 'Midas touch'. Contexts within and outwith biogeography-e.g., methods, knowledge, climate, biodiversity, politics-are continually changing, and at times it can be challenging to establish or maintain relevance. In so many races with the Red Queen, we suggest that biogeography will enjoy greatest success if we also increasingly engage with the epistemology of our discipline. © 2016 by the article author(s).",Anthropocene; Biodiversity conservation; Birds; Ecoinformatics; Functional diversity; Island biogeography; Macroecology; Mammals; Paleoecology; Phylogenetics; Plants; Species distribution modelling (SDM),,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010220025,,TRUE,?

Morphologically similar microconchids and Anticalyptraea may have exploited a more similar ecological niche than the straight-shelled cornulitids.

Fucoid species exhibited diverse responses to glacial-interglacial cycles, but evidence indicates there were a few common refugial areas such as north-western Iberia, the Celtic Sea (Brittany/Ireland) region and the North-west Atlantic. In genetically rich refugial areas, pervasive genetic breaks confirmed presently limited gene flow between adjacent distinct genetic groups. In contrast with the maintenance of sharp genetic breaks, most species experienced extensive migration during post-glacial expansion. Poleward migrations in the North-east Atlantic followed routes along north-western Ireland and the transgressing English Channel. These patterns support the role of density-blocking in maintaining sharp genetic breaks at contact zones, and of long-distance dispersal from range edges in mediating expansion into uninhabited regions. The data also indicate that expansions involve mostly the genetic groups located at range edges rather than the entire species’ gene pool, both poleward during interglacials and toward warmer regions during glacial periods. Fucoid expansions have also been linked to introgressive recombination of genomes at (and beyond) contact zones and to gene surfing leading to present large-scale dominance by alleles that were located at the expanding edge. Phylogeographic approaches have also proven useful to identify and track the sources of introductions linked to marine traffic. The integration of environmental niche models with molecular data have further allowed hindcasting southern distributions during glaciation and predicting the potentially negative effects of future climate warming, including the loss of vulnerable, unique trailing-edge lineages, as species’ ranges are predicted to continue shifting northward. Collectively, these studies have contributed greatly to elucidating the links between past and ongoing climatic shifts, range dynamics and geographical patterns of genetic variability in the North Atlantic. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.",Climatic refugia; Comparative phylogeography; Fucoid seaweeds; Genetic diversity; Glacial-interglacial cycles; Latitudinal range shifts; Marine introductions; North-atlantic intertidal; Ongoing climate change; Pathways of range expansion; Rafting; Restricted dispersal,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960517544,,FALSE,

Ancient DNA suggests that the Arctic fox went extinct in Europe at the end of the Pleistocene and that Scandinavia was subsequently recolonized from Siberia, indicating inability to track its habitat through space as climate changed. Using ecological niche modeling, we found that climatically suitable conditions for Arctic fox were found in Scandinavia both during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the mid-Holocene. Our results are supported by fossil occurrences from the last glacial. Furthermore, the model projection for the LGM, validated with fossil records, suggested an approximate distance of 2000 km between suitable Arctic conditions and the Tibetan Plateau well within the dispersal distance of the species, supporting the recently proposed hypothesis of range expansion from an origin on the Tibetan Plateau to the rest of Eurasia. The fact that the Arctic fox disappeared from Scandinavia despite suitable conditions suggests that extant populations may be more sensitive to climate change than previously thought. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Arctic fox; Ecological niche modeling; Fennoscandia; Last glacial maximum; Out-of-Tibet hypothesis; Refugia,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955169709,,TRUE,

Fossils and phylogenetic studies of plants and animals demonstrate that tropical regions are the source for almost all groups of organisms, and these groups are composed of a mixture of ancient and recently derived lineages. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the large extent of tropical environments during the past 10-50 million years, together with greater climatic stability, has promoted speciation and reduced extinction rates. Energy availability appears to only indirectly contribute to global patterns of species diversity, especially considering how some marine diversity gradients can be completely decoupled from temperature and productivity gradients. Instead, climate stability and time-integrated area together determine the baselines of both terrestrial and marine global diversity patterns.

Past sea-level changes enlarged palaeodrainages and so connected currently isolated rivers, whereas changes in environmental conditions reduced forest cover and may have constrained the movement of fish specialized to this habitat. We assayed genetic variation in Hollandichthys multifasciatus, a freshwater fish endemic to the Atlantic Forest of coastal Brazil, to test the relative importance of these factors in shaping current patterns of genetic divergence. Location: River drainages along the south-eastern Brazilian coast. Methods: A GIS was used to reconstruct palaeodrainages during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Niche modelling was used to infer areas of stability for the southern Atlantic Forest sensu stricto (present and LGM). The contribution of river connections inside or outside areas of stability was evaluated using a calibrated phylogeny, analyses of molecular variance, and Bayesian skyline plots from two mtDNA loci. Results: Analyses of 182 individuals from 26 populations and 12 palaeodrainages indicated that structure associated with palaeodrainages explains 75% of the genetic variation among populations, with estimated divergence times occurring within the Pleistocene. The variation explained by palaeodrainages and estimated population sizes was unrelated to the ecological stability of the region. Main conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of Pleistocene palaeodrainages in structuring genetic divergence patterns. The analyses suggest that past connections due to sea-level retreat played a significant role in the diversification of the ichthyofauna along the Brazilian coastal drainages. Moreover, the lack of a signature of habitat stability in structuring genetic variation suggests that refugia may be less important in structuring genetic diversity for freshwater species than for terrestrial species. In addition, our work highlights the utility of a GIS-based approach to recover past connections among coastal basins. Understanding these connections is crucial for studying diversification of riverine organisms and for identifying areas of conservation priority. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Hollandichthys; Atlantic Forest; Forest stability; Interglacial; Last Glacial Maximum; MtDNA; Palaeodrainages; Riverine organisms; Sea-level changes,Bayesian analysis; calibration; coastal zone; divergence; drainage; forest cover; freshwater ecosystem; genetic variation; GIS; interglacial; Last Glacial Maximum; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeny; population size; sea level change; teleost; variance analysis; Atlantic Forest; Brazil,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955179268,,TRUE,

There are two extreme conventional responses that have kept divided the scientific community in this regard for almost forty years: (a) No; that is to say, the well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP). (b) Yes; that is to say, the well-known hypothesis of full functional redundancy (HFR). Obviously, the reliability of both responses depends on an underlying and even more essential requisite: that the ecological niche of a given species can be assessed with such accuracy as we could want in order to detect the degree in which it is shared between coexisting species. This article is the seventh in a continuous series of interconnected recent publications that promotes an alternative understanding of ecology and evolutionary biology which is in favor of strong and mutually fruitful analytical links between biology and physics. This article analyzes the statistical behavior of ecological niches by taking into account two indicators that are essential to perform the ecological niche of all species: species diversity per plot (Hp) and eco-kinetic energy (Ee) as a proxy for trophic energy in a scalar field Hp, Ee in which an oscillating performance of ecological niches is deployed. According to our results, in the same measurement in which the accuracy of Hp assessments increases (reduction of Hp's standard deviation: σHp) the accuracy of Ee assessment decreases (increment of σEe), and vice versa, in agreement with a pattern that is completely equivalent to that of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics (i.e.: σHpσEe1/2heec/2π where heec: ecological equivalent of Planck's constant found in previous publications). As a result, the ecological niche is, even in principle in addition to in practice, indeterminable with enough exactness to arrive to a categorical response to the above-stated question. This means that CEP and HFR are simultaneously true and false in the same measure, because the only feasible option to keep the functional stability of ecosystems is a wave-like combination of both options: when species are pushed to a high degree of coexistence (increase of partition of the gradient) in regard to Hp values (a trend in favor of HFR), their degree of coexistence in regard to Ee values diminishes (decrease of partition of the Ee gradient, a trend in favor of CEP), and vice versa. The final sections of the article highlight the eco-evolutionary, biogeographical and socio-economic meaning of this result, by offering plausible alternative explanations to a wide spectrum of phenomena that appear to be only partially understood so far, e.g.: the contradictory results about the relationship between body size, species diversity and macroevolutionary rates; the general environmental scenario in favor of macroevolutionary leaps with a low probability to leave footprints in the fossil record; the unnecessary, although stimulant, influence of geographic isolation to promote evolutionary changes; the island rule; and the general meaning of the interaction between nature and society. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Competitive exclusion; Ecological equivalent of Planck's constant; Ecological niche; Ecological state equation; Functional redundancy; Uncertainty principle,Biodiversity; Biology; Equations of state; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Quantum theory; Redundancy; Uncertainty analysis; Competitive exclusion; Ecological niche; Ecological state; Functional redundancy; Planck's constants; Uncertainty principles; Ecology; body size; coexistence; ecosystem function; evolutionary biology; niche partitioning; quantum mechanics; species diversity; uncertainty role,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940373367,,FALSE,

Traditionally, carbon and nitrogen isotope values have been used to infer dietary and habitat preferences. Oxygen isotopes are used less frequently but may complement the ecological information provided by carbon and nitrogen, particularly in densely forested or arid environments. Additionally, because oxygen is preserved in both bioapatite and collagen, it is useful for paleoecological studies. To investigate the suitability of oxygen isotopes for complementing and building on ecological applications of carbon and nitrogen isotopes, we analyze all three isotopes in bone collagen for nearly identical assemblages of Costa Rican mammals in two ecologically distinct habitats - an evergreen rainforest and a seasonal dry forest. We assess the degree to which differences in habitat, activity pattern, diet, arboreality, and thermoregulation are revealed by each of the isotope systems. Our results highlight the potential of oxygen isotopes in modern and paleoecological contexts. In addition to reflecting habitat type, oxygen isotope values in collagen distinguish species on the basis of vertical habitat stratification and drinking behavior. Within a locality, individuals with low oxygen isotope values likely track meteoric water, whereas those with elevated values most likely consume evaporatively-enriched plant tissues, such as canopy leaves. These patterns will be useful in reconstructing paleoenvironments and interpreting ecological differences among taxa both extant and extinct. © 2015 Crowley, Melin, Yeakel and Dominy.",Carbon; Collagen; Costa Rica; Niche overlap; Nitrogen; Oxygen,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978011924,,FALSE,

However, the mechanisms responsible for such a distribution remain unclear. Two key hypotheses are that: (1) the diversity reflects adaptation to ultramafic substrates that ecologically filtered plant colonists; and (2) the diversity stems from wet climatic conditions that have persisted in New Caledonia during the late Quaternary while Australia and some nearby islands experienced widespread extinction events. Here, we investigate which hypothesis better explains the disharmony of relict angiosperms in New Caledonia. Location: New Caledonia (South West Pacific Ocean). Methods: We built species distribution models from herbarium data to determine the environmental correlates for 60 relict angiosperm taxa. Environmental variables used to characterize habitats included vegetation, substrate, and climate variables. We then tested whether the variety of xylem conduit structures borne by New Caledonian relict angiosperms, which is expected to affect plant hydraulic capacity, was correlated with habitat preference. Finally, we analysed species prevalence on different substrates and projected habitat size and distribution to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Results: We found a clear habitat preference among relict angiosperms for rain forests located on non-ultramafic substrates, with the exception of taxa bearing true vessels with simple perforation plates, which harboured a wider habitat breadth. We also showed that these rain forest habitats experienced a range reduction and an eastward shift during the LGM, forming two refugial areas located on the warm and rainy east coast of Grande Terre. Main conclusions: Prevalence of relict angiosperms in habitats characterized by low evaporative demand appears to be related to xylem hydraulic limitations. The disharmony of relict angiosperms in New Caledonia therefore arose from the persistence of rain forests in the island despite global fluctuations in climate during the Quaternary that affected floras in the region.

This sequence could be divided into three parts, basal fossil-less strata have related to Sachun Formation base on their stratigraphical position, the middle part involves dolomitic to dolomitic limestone of Jahrum Formation, and the upper part consists of the Lower Asmari Formation. In general, the bulk of the section consists of marine deposits, and it is possible to divide them in to several parts base on benthic foraminiferal biozones. The Late Paleocene to the Early Eocene (the Lower Jahrum Formation) has been distinguished by the Miscellanea, Kathina, Alveolina, Fallotella, Lokhartia, Orbitolites, and small rotalids Assemblage Zone. The Middle Eocene (the Middle Jahrum Formation) has been characterized by the Somalina Total Range Zone and the Nummulites-Alveolina Assemblage Zone. The Late Eocene (the Upper Jahrum Formation) has been distinguished by the Chapmanina, Pllatispira, Baccullogypsinoides Assemblage zone, and the outcrop of the Asmari Formation belongs to the Early Oligocene Base on the Nummulites vascus, Nummulites fichteli Assemblage Zone. Clustering content benthic foraminifera in the studied section base on their morphology, coiling, feeding habits, and habitats lead to identification of 15 distinct assemblages with similar ecological niches. Paleoecological reconstructions base on benthic foraminiferal communities indicate that five major ecological habitats include tidal flat and shore, restricted shelf, nonrestricted shelf, oligotrophic shelf, and open marine. © 2015, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Asmari; Early Oligocene; Jahrum; Late Paleocene; Zagros,benthic foraminifera; biostratigraphy; biozonation; depositional sequence; dolomite; identification method; limestone; niche; Oligocene; outcrop; Paleocene; Paleocene-Eocene boundary; paleoecology; reconstruction; Iran; Zagros Basin; Alveolina; Foraminifera; Nummulites; Nummulites fichteli,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942553389,,FALSE,

This paper utilizes the Pliocene to Recent fossil record of mollusks to identify determinants of species' extinction over the past three million years of Earth history. Location: Western Atlantic. Methods: We focus on 92 bivalve and gastropod species that lived during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; ∼3.264-3.025Ma) and have either since gone extinct or are still extant. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the vulnerability of these species to extinction as a function of both fundamental (FN) and realized (RN) niche breadth proxies, geographic range size, and amount of suitable area available to them during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ∼21Ka). Results: Geographic range size emerged as a key predictor of extinction for the studied mollusk species, with RN breadth and amount of suitable area available during the LGM as secondary predictors. By contrast, FN breadth was not a significant predictor of extinction risk. Main conclusions: The failure to recover FN breadth as a predictor of extinction may suggest that extinction resistance is achieved when species are more successful in filling the geographic extent of their fundamental tolerances. That is, when it comes to species' survival, being a generalist or specialist sensu stricto may be secondary to the unique historical, dispersal, and biotic constraints that dictate a species' occupation of suitable environments, and consequently of geographic space, at a particular time. Identifying the factors that promote extinction is important because of the time-intensive nature of estimating extinction risk for individual species and populations, and because of the rising concerns about the future of marine ecosystems and biodiversity. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Ecological niche modeling; Extinction selectivity; Fossils; Fundamental niche; Last glacial maximum; Macroecology; Macroevolution; Niche volume; Realized niche,ecological modeling; fossil record; geographical distribution; Last Glacial Maximum; mollusc; niche breadth; paleobiogeography; paleoecology; Pliocene; range size; survival; timescale; Bivalvia; Gastropoda; Mollusca,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940861196,,TRUE,

Here, we examine the functional diversity of a Middle Triassic paleocommunity in the wake of the largest mass extinction in Earth's history, the Permo-Triassic mass extinction (PTME). Field data was collected and analyzed for a highly diverse invertebrate marine fossil assemblage, the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Leidapo Member (Qingyan Formation) of Qingyan, south China. Previously interpreted to represent a fully restructured paleocommunity in the aftermath of the PTME, our results indicate that the fauna of Leidapo Member had high taxonomic diversity and high functional richness, however was functionally uneven. Despite the presence of 24 different functional groups, the paleocommunity was numerically and ecologically dominated by one functional group consisting of mostly attached epifaunal suspension feeding brachiopods. The overwhelming dominance of this Anisian paleocommunity by one functional group implies that either, 1) resource availability in the community was uneven, and/or 2) strong environmental or niche filtering was in effect. As such, while the Anisian Leidapo Member paleocommunity was deposited in a fairly stable shallow water paleoenvironment, this biotic assemblage would have been very vulnerable to biotic and environmental perturbations. While it is uncertain whether or not this pattern is typical of paleocommunities in the aftermath of the PTME, these results imply that some Anisian paleocommunities may not have been as fully restructured as previously thought, and may have been inherently unstable due to the numerous biotic and environmental changes present in the Triassic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Functional diversity; Middle triassic; Paleoecology; Permo-Triassic; Qingyan formation; South China,Wakes; Functional diversity; Paleoecology; Permo-Triassic; Qingyan formation; South China; Triassic; Ecology; abundance; Anisian; dominance; field method; fossil assemblage; invertebrate; marine record; mass extinction; niche; paleobotany; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; reconstruction; spatial distribution; species diversity; species evenness; China; South China Block; Brachiopoda; Invertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939555265,,FALSE,*

However, the changes in community structure can also be explored using the functional trait approach. Investigation of functional traits in palaeoecological records can inform about the mechanisms through which abiotic variables such as temperature or moisture impact communities. Moreover, changes in functional traits provide information about changes in ecosystem functioning and can potentially lead to the reconstruction of past processes at the ecosystem scale. Here, we use five key functional traits of arcellinid testate amoebae (TAs), a group of protozoa that are key actors in the microbial foodwebs in peatlands. We apply this approach to the subfossil TA Holocene record of four geographically independent peatlands from Alaska, Switzerland, Poland and Russia. We found that species with larger shells were frequently eliminated from the communities most likely as a result of a switch towards drier conditions. However, when conditions were wetter, species with large shells and species with small shells could coexist because they differed in their trophic niche (i.e. preys). Our results show direct but site-specific links between TA trait data and the depth to water table and pH data inferred from TA species composition. This suggests that past environmental changes influenced both species composition and community function in these ecosystems. Overall, this study demonstrates that species- and trait-based approaches yield complementary information on past environmental changes. For instance, while taxonomic approaches reveal the changes in community composition over time, investigation of traits informs both on the causes and the consequences of these changes on ecosystem functioning. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",community-weighted mean of traits (CWM); long-term changes; microbial ecology; palaeoecology; protist; trait-based approach; transfer function,food web; functional change; Holocene; long-term change; microbial ecology; moisture content; paleoenvironment; paleotemperature; peat; protist; subfossil; transfer function; Alaska; Poland; Russian Federation; Switzerland; United States; Arcellinida; Protista; Protozoa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939552583,,FALSE,*

Despite the interest in explaining the timing and the mechanisms via which agricultural products spread to the roof of the world, current models for the spread of agriculture to this region have been simplistic and the presence of crop domesticates is often straightforwardly interpreted as indicating the existence of an agricultural system at the site. This is largely due to a fundamental lack of understanding of where crops could be grown in prehistory on the Plateau. Although it has generally been assumed that moving agriculture into this area was challenging, little work has specifically addressed the constraints imposed on humans as they moved crops into this area. Employing an agro-ecological niche model, I formally model the constraints that were faced by humans as they moved a series of crops into the Tibetan Plateau between the 4th and 1st millennium cal. BC. Based on the results of this analysis, I argue that the end of the climatic optimum meant that millet agriculture was no longer a viable strategy in many parts of the Eastern Himalayas. The arrival of frost tolerant crops in the 2nd millennium BC provided new opportunities in the cooler post climatic optimum world. These models further reveal that sites that have been previously considered as engaged directly in agricultural production may have been more distantly connected to an agricultural lifestyle than previously thought. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",agriculture; barley; ecological niche modeling; growing degree days; millet; pastoralism; Tibetan Plateau; wheat,agroecology; barley; farming system; frost; Holocene; lifestyle; millet; niche overlap; paleoclimate; pastoralism; prehistoric; wheat; China; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939511638,,FALSE,?

The mammalian order Carnivora, which comprises 286 species, displays the traditional latitudinal diversity gradient seen in almost all mammalian orders. Yet the processes driving high species richness in the tropics may be fundamentally different in this group from that in other mammalian groups. Indeed, a recent study suggested that in Carnivora, unlike in all other major mammalian orders, net diversification rates are not higher in the tropics than in temperate regions. Our goal was thus to understand the reasons why there are more species of Carnivora in the tropics. Location: World-wide. Methods: We reconstructed the biogeographical history of Carnivora using a time-calibrated phylogeny of the clade comprising all terrestrial species and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis models. We also analysed a fossil dataset of carnivoran genera to examine how the latitudinal distribution of Carnivora varied through time. Results: Our biogeographical analyses suggest that Carnivora originated in the East Palaearctic (i.e. Central Asia, China) in the early Palaeogene. Multiple independent lineages dispersed to low latitudes following three main paths: toward Africa, toward India/Southeast Asia and toward South America via the Bering Strait. These dispersal events were probably associated with local extinctions at high latitudes. Fossil data corroborate a high-latitude origin of the group, followed by late dispersal events toward lower latitudes in the Neogene. Main conclusions: Unlike most other mammalian orders, which originated and diversified at low latitudes and dispersed 'out of the tropics', Carnivora originated at high latitudes, and subsequently dispersed southward. Our study provides an example of combining phylogenetic and fossil data to understand the generation and maintenance of global-scale geographical variations in species richness. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Biogeographical history; Carnivora origin; Dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis; Diversification; Out of the tropics; Tropical niche conservatism,carnivore; dispersal; extinction; fossil; mammal; niche; paleobiogeography; Paleogene; phylogenetics; phylogeny; speciation (biology); species diversity; species richness; Africa; Central Asia; China; India; South America; Southeast Asia; Carnivora; Mammalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938994936,,FALSE,

They are also among the regions with the greatest number of non-native invasive species. However, not all introduced species become invasive. Previously, we found that non-native Asteraceae closely related to native species are more likely to establish and spread in California, USA. We conducted reciprocal studies in another mediterranean-climate region with high species richness, the Italian Peninsula. Mediterranean Basin invaders in the Astereae mostly originated in temperate North America, whereas the invasive Cardueae of California are primarily from the Mediterranean Basin. Location: The Mediterranean Basin (Italy). Methods: Utilizing the first fossil-calibrated molecular phylogenies of the tribe Astereae, we explored the evolutionary patterns among native and non-native taxa within this group. To elucidate the mechanisms driving the observed patterns, we modelled the ecological niches of Astereae species on a global scale and examined correlations between ecological similarity and evolutionary relatedness among taxa. Results: Not only were invasive taxa highly clustered among natives, they were also more closely related to natives than were non-invasive introduced taxa. We found that invasive species had higher degrees of niche overlap with native species than did non-invasive introduced species. Moreover, pairwise niche distance among species was significantly correlated with evolutionary time, indicating that the ecological niche is phylogenetically conserved. Main conclusions: The results of our study are consistent with those from our work in California, suggesting that introduced Asteraceae taxa that are closely related to native species are likely to become invasive on both sides of the Atlantic. Furthermore, existing ecological attributes seem to drive these evolutionary patterns. We suggest that potential invaders closely related to natives should be considered as high priorities for management. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Astereae; Biological invasions; Darwin's naturalization hypothesis; Invasive species; Mediterranean climate region; Niche modelling; Phylogenetic niche conservatism; Phylogenetics,biological invasion; evolutionary biology; herb; hypothesis testing; invasive species; Mediterranean environment; niche; phylogenetics; species richness; California; Italian Peninsula; United States; Asteraceae; Astereae; Cardueae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938963337,,TRUE,

Location: The Western Palaearctic. Methods: We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 57 individuals from across the distribution of the species. The analysis integrated ecological niche modelling (ENM), approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), measures of genetic diversity and Bayesian phylogenetic methods. Results: We identified two deep lineages: a western lineage, restricted to the Pyrenees and the Alps, and an eastern lineage, which expanded across the mountain ranges east of the Dinarides (Croatia). ENM projections of past conditions predicted that climatic suitability was reduced during cold stages in the areas inhabited by the western lineage, while the opposite trend was observed in the mountains inhabited by the eastern lineage. The palaeodemographic scenario that best fitted our data is consistent with the western lineage population size having shrunk repeatedly because of the extensive glaciation events that occurred in the Alps and Pyrenees during the Pleistocene. In contrast, the eastern lineage maintained a constant population size as is consistent with more limited glaciation in the mountains of south-eastern Europe and the Middle East.

For example, little is known about how Cladocera (Crustacea, Branchiopoda), often dominant invertebrates and key ecological indicators, have responded to recent warming on broad spatial and temporal scales. Here, we use lake sediment records to test the hypothesis that recent, intensive warming in the western Canadian Arctic has resulted in consistent shifts in the composition of cladoceran assemblages. Location: Small, first-order lakes in the Mackenzie Delta region of the western Canadian Arctic. Methods: Sediment cores representing the recent past (approximately 150-200 years) were obtained from five lakes spanning a strong climatic gradient. Subfossil remains of Cladocera were identified and enumerated and overall primary production was inferred using spectroscopic techniques. The habitat preferences and feeding strategy of each taxon were compared. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis was used to estimate compositional turnover since 1850, and compared with that of three cladoceran assemblages from Nova Scotia, to place high-latitude changes in context. Results: Cladoceran assemblage changes occurred coincident with the timing of known regional warming and were strongly linked to estimated changes in primary production. In the northern and deepest lakes, an increase in the planktonic, filter-feeding taxon Bosmina spp. coincided with a decrease in the generalist littoral taxa Chydorus cf. brevilabris and Alona circumfimbriata. In the more southern lakes, an increase in macrophyte-associated scrapers Acroperus harpae and Eurycercus spp. occurred concurrently with decreases in generalist taxa. In one lake, an increase in another specialist, an obligate mud-dwelling taxon, was observed. Main conclusions: In the western Canadian Arctic, warming has resulted in an increase in cladoceran taxa occupying more specialized feeding and habitat niches. Generalist taxa capable of occupying multiple habitats and employing diverse feeding strategies have been systematically replaced by more specialist species. This response is analogous to what has been inferred for algal communities across the Northern Hemisphere, and represents the first evidence of consistent cladoceran changes to recent climate warming in high-latitude regions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Arctic; Canada; Cladocera; Climate change; Lakes; Mackenzie Delta; Palaeolimnology; Sediments; Warming; Zooplankton,algal community; altitude; crustacean; environmental gradient; feeding behavior; filter feeding; habitat selection; hypothesis testing; lake ecosystem; Northern Hemisphere; paleolimnology; primary production; sediment core; spatiotemporal analysis; subfossil; trophic level; warming; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Mackenzie Delta; Northwest Territories; Nova Scotia; Acroperus harpae; algae; Alona circumfimbriata; Bosmina; Branchiopoda; Chydorus brevilabris; Cladocera; Crustacea; Eurycercus; Invertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936985051,,FALSE,

In this line of argument, small-scale technology and decentralised ownership, in the field of energy and beyond, are commonly regarded as potential precursors of a sustainable degrowth society. However, these systemic and conceptual considerations have been rarely assessed empirically. This paper wishes to address this research gap. It presents the exploratory findings of an EU-wide survey conducted in 2013 and further discusses the conceptualisation of small-scale ownership structures in renewable energy as an alternative to the community energy concept. Secondly, the paper relates the debates on degrowth to small-scale renewable energy schemes and illustrates its argument with four case studies from Wales, Italy, Spain, and Germany. These cases represent different organisational forms, diverse spatial settings, and varying national policy contexts. In its observations, this paper draws on the concept of collective and politically motivated renewable energy projects (CPE). While still mainly found in niches across Europe and essentially linked to environmental and social movements, we argue that CPE can potentially become blueprints for a turn towards a degrowth practice that will foster the democratisation of renewable energy production. © 2015, Springer Japan.",Community energy; Degrowth; Energy cooperatives; Energy geography; Energy transition; Remunicipalisation; Renewable energy,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937816868,,FALSE,

One approach to allocation is to partition the embodied resources in proportion to a criterion, such as product mass or cost. Many practitioners apply multiple partitioning criteria to avoid choosing one arbitrarily. However, life cycle results from different allocation methods frequently contradict each other, making it difficult or impossible for the practitioner to draw any meaningful conclusions from the study. Using the matrix notation for life-cycle inventory data, we show that an inventory that requires allocation leads to an ill-posed problem: an inventory based on allocation is one of an infinite number of inventories that are highly dependent upon allocation methods. This insight is applied to comparative life-cycle assessment (LCA), in which products with the same function but different life cycles are compared. Recently, there have been several studies that applied multiple allocation methods and found that different products were preferred under different methods. We develop the Comprehensive Allocation Investigation Strategy (CAIS) to examine any given inventory under all possible allocation decisions, enabling us to detect comparisons that are not robust to allocation, even when the comparison appears robust under conventional partitioning methods. While CAIS does not solve the ill-posed problem, it provides a systematic way to parametrize and examine the effects of partitioning allocation. The practical usefulness of this approach is demonstrated with two case studies.

Location: Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Methods: Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of individuals collected throughout the species' ranges were sequenced and then analysed using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Species tree analysis, Bayesian species delimitation, divergence time inference, historical demography, palaeodistribution modelling, and niche divergence tests were used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the Amazilia species, and the isolation-with-migration coalescent model was assessed to determine whether genetic divergence between Amazilia species occurred in the presence of gene flow. Results: Genetic divergence between A. violiceps and A. viridifrons was shallow, with incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. Species delimitation supported three independent lineages: A. violiceps populations located north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt; a mixture of A. violiceps south of the volcanic belt and A. viridifrons populations; and A. villadai populations east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Gene flow and divergence time estimates, and demographic and palaeodistribution patterns support the model of species diversification by isolation with migration and habitat shifting in response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Main conclusions: The process of speciation in the Amazilia species complex may be explained by the combined effects of isolation resulting from the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the lowlands at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and habitat shifting in response to Quaternary climatic changes. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Amazilia; Environmental space; Habitat shift; Hummingbirds; Introgression; Isthmus of Tehuantepec; Migration; Niche conservatism; Speciation; Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt,bird; climate change; divergence; gene flow; genetic differentiation; habitat conservation; introgression; migration; niche; phylogenetics; speciation (biology); species diversity; transition zone; volcanic belt; Isthmus of Tehuantepec; Mexico [North America]; Amazilia; Amazilia violiceps; Amazilia viridifrons; Trochilidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931056382,,TRUE,

Related to high sea surface temperatures (SST), bleaching events are expected to increase as a consequence of future global warming. However, response to climate change is still uncertain as future low-latitude climatic conditions have no present-day analogue. Sea surface temperatures during the Eocene epoch were warmer than forecasted changes for the coming century, and distributions of corals during the Eocene may help to inform models forecasting the future of coral reefs. We coupled contemporary and Eocene coral occurrences with information on their respective climatic conditions to model the thermal niche of coral reefs and its potential response to projected climate change. We found that under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, the global suitability for coral reefs may increase up to 16% by 2100, mostly due to improved suitability of higher latitudes. In contrast, in its current range, coral reef suitability may decrease up to 46% by 2100. Reduction in thermal suitability will be most severe in biodiversity hotspots, especially in the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Our results suggest that many contemporary hotspots for coral reefs, including those that have been refugia in the past, spatially mismatch with future suitable areas for coral reefs posing challenges to conservation actions under climate change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Fish; Fossil; Sea surface temperature; Specialists; Species distribution model; Species richness,bleaching; climate change; coral reef; environmental disturbance; fish; fossil; global warming; population distribution; sea surface temperature; specialist; species diversity; species richness; Malay Archipelago; Anthozoa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931009261,,TRUE,?

The tropical niche conservatism hypothesis proposes that this relationship is driven by the evolutionarily conserved ancestral tolerances of species to the warm environments in which most clades originated. The hypothesis predicts that the slope of the richness-temperature gradient is positively related to the temperature of the period during which the clade originated. Here, we test this prediction for bird and mammal families in the Americas and by revisiting a global analysis of 343 groups of organisms (Romdal etal., 2013, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 22, 344-350). Location: The Americas and world-wide. Methods: We computed the slope of the species richness-current temperature relationship within each bird and mammal family in the Americas. We used palaeoclimate reconstructions to estimate temperature at the time of the family's origination, taken from the fossil record. We then tested how much of the among-family variance in the richness-temperature slope could be explained by the temperature at the time of family origination. We repeated this test for the 343 groups of organisms world-wide. Results: Contrary to the prediction of tropical niche conservatism, the temperature at which bird and mammal families originated does not explain variations in the richness-temperature relationships. Similarly, we show that, although the predicted relationship was statistically detected in a broad range of groups of organisms in a previous study, it in fact statistically explains only 1.2-2.9% of the variance among groups in the slope of richness gradients.

We tested the ENM approach to infer past range dynamics of cork oak, a keystone species of the Mediterranean Biome, from 130ka to the present time. Hindcasting implications would deal with a better species risk assessment and conservation management for the future.We modelled present and past occurrence of cork oak using seven ENM algorithms, starting from 63,733 spatially unique presence points at 30 arc-second resolution. Fourteen environmental variables were used and four time slices were considered (Last Interglacial, Last Glacial Maximum, mid-Holocene and present time). A threshold-independent evaluation of the goodness-of-fit of the models was evaluated by means of ROC curve and fossil or historical evidences were used to validate the results.Four weighted average maps depicted the dynamics of area suitability for cork oak in the last 130ka. The derived species autoecology allowed its long-term occurrence in the Mediterranean without striking range reduction or shifting. Fossil and historical post-processing validation support the modelled past spatial extension and a neglected species presence at Levantine until the recent time.Despite the severe climatic oscillation since the Last Glacial Maximum, cork oak potential distribution area experienced limited range changes, confirming its strong link with the Mediterranean Basin. The ecological amplitude of Quercus suber could be therefore adopted as a reference to trace the Mediterranean bioclimate area.

This hypothesis has been subjected to continuous debate since the 1980s, essentially because empirical studies have shown contrasting patterns. Moreover, it has been proposed that species performance might not be higher at the geographic range centre but rather at the environmental optimum or at sites presenting greater environmental stability in time. In this paper we re-evaluate the CPH by disentangling the effects of geographic, climatic and historical centrality/marginality on the demography of three widely distributed plant species and the genetic diversity of one of them. Location: Europe and North America. Methods: Based on a species distribution modelling approach, we test whether demographic parameters (vital rates, stochastic population growth rates, density) of three plant species of contrasting life-forms, and the genetic diversity of one of them, are higher at their geographic range centres, climatic optima or projected glacial refugia. Results: While geographic, climatic and historical centre-periphery gradients are often not concordant, overall, none of them explain well the distribution of species demographic performance, whereas genetic diversity responds positively only to a historical centrality, related to post-glacial range dynamics. Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the response of species performance to three centrality gradients, considering all the components of different species life cycles and genetic diversity information across continental distributions. Our results are inconsistent with the idea that geographically, climatically or historically marginal populations generally perform worse than central ones. We particularly emphasize the importance of adopting an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand the relative effects of contemporary versus historical and geographic versus ecological factors on the distribution of species performance. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Abundant-centre model; Central-marginal hypothesis; Climatic niche; Genetic diversity; Last Glacial Maximum; Latitude; Plant demography; Population performance; Species distribution models,climate variation; ecological modeling; geographical distribution; Last Glacial Maximum; niche; paleoclimate; population decline; population genetics; Europe; North America,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929659929,,TRUE,?*

Two alternative diversification scenarios were tested in two co-distributed, Northern Hemisphere clades: (1) clade ancestors were temperate, and environmental niche has been conserved over evolutionary time, implying that speciation was driven by vicariance associated with ice sheet formation; and (2) clade ancestors were Arctic, and species convergently adapted to temperate environmental conditions, implying that speciation was driven by repeated adaption to temperate environments. Location: Northern Hemisphere Arctic and subarctic oceans. Methods: Fifty-five new sequences of four genes from 23 tissue samples were combined with 10 GenBank sequences to generate a time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis. Combining the phylogeny with information on species' ecological niche tolerances inferred from correlational models, I reconstructed ancestral environmental tolerances of each of the focal clades. These results were combined with Bayesian area-based biogeographical analysis and regional palaeoclimatic history to develop a holistic biogeographical history of Gadinae. Results: Of 18 environmental variables describing species' tolerances to salinity, temperature, sea ice concentration, and mixed layer depth, only mean, maximum and minimum sea bottom temperature, and mean and minimum sea surface temperature showed phylogenetic signal across Gadinae. Both ecological niche and geographical distributions of gadine fishes are largely conservative, but two clades contain both Pacific and Atlantic species. Focal clade divergence time estimates suggest a Pliocene origin for both, with further Pleistocene divergence. Main conclusions: Reconstructed ancestral environmental tolerances of crown cods and tomcods support a temperate origin of both groups. The timing of diversification of these two clades and the intolerance of temperate species to sea ice suggest that cyclical Arctic ice formation drove divergence. Future sea ice reduction may have dramatic consequences for distributions and persistence of commercially important species when currently allopatric temperate species come into secondary contact. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Arctic; Climate change; Dispersal; Ecological niche modelling; Gadinae; Pleistocene; Radiation; Speciation pump; Temperate; Vicariance,allopatry; ancestry; arctic environment; biogeography; climate variation; divergence; evolutionary theory; gadoid; geographical distribution; paleoclimate; persistence; phylogenetics; physiological response; Pleistocene; sea ice; speciation (biology); Gadidae; Gadinae; Microgadus; Pisces; Teleostei,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929049728,,TRUE,

However, current front-running CCS technologies require a significant amount of energy to operate, and would require the electricity output of a power station to which they were fitted to increase by 22%-26%. Because of this, alternative CCS technologies have been proposed and are in the process of scaling up to the point where they could be fitted on either fossil-fuelled power stations or large industrial processes. Calcium and chemical looping (together comprising high-temperature looping cycles) are two of the most promising technologies, benefitting from high efficiency and reactors that are available at scale (essentially) off the shelf. Careful heat integration and consideration of exergy destruction is one of the main reasons for the high efficiencies of these processes. The requirement for low toxicity and high durability, reactivity and capacity is discussed in the context of what makes a good carrier of either CO2 or O2 for use in calcium or chemical looping. There are a number of industrial processes (e.g. iron and steel production, cement manufacture and steam generation) forwhich there are niche applications of high-temperature looping cycles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To improve the basis for managing these key ecosystems, we selected a Tertiary relict woodland (Argania spinosa) in order to clarify the sensitivity to long-term climate change (the present, the past glacial-interglacial cycle and under future scenarios). We also discuss the impact of long-term human land use for the distribution of dry woodlands in North Africa. Location: North Africa. Methods: To assess whether the argan woodland is in equilibrium with current climate, we used species distribution modelling (SDM) to estimate its potential range. Then, SDM was used to estimate its potential distribution during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21,000 BP) and the Middle Holocene (Mid-Holocene; 6,000 BP). Model predictions for past scenarios were compared with Quaternary palaeorecords to evaluate their accuracy. Finally, we forecasted changes in the potential range to year 2080 to assess its likely future range dynamics. Results: At the LGM, suitable areas occurred at more southern latitudes, where the Sahara Desert currently lies, while suitable areas in the Mid-Holocene shifted northwards, occupying areas similar to those of today. The estimated past distributions are consistent with palaeorecords, providing evidence for the important role of Quaternary climate changes in driving dry woodland range dynamics. The current range-filling constitutes 44% of the potential distribution, probably primarily reflecting anthropic land-use effects. Future climate change is forecast not to cause latitudinal/altitudinal range shifts, but rather an overall range contraction. Conclusions: The models reflect the high sensitivity of the dry woodland ecosystem to past climate changes, in agreement with palaeorecords. The estimated climatic sensitivity also predicts severe range contraction during future climate change. Consequently, management strategies for dry woodlands should be developed to facilitate their in situ survival, particularly by reducing the currently intensive human pressure. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.",Argania spinosa; Palaeobiogeography; Pollen fossil records; Quaternary Climate Change; Sapotaceae; Species Distribution Modelling,Argania spinosa; Sapotaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924716068,,TRUE,

However, quantifying the relative importance that each factor had in the extinction risk of species has been challenging, mostly due to the spatio-temporal biases of fossil records, which complicate the calibration of realistic and accurate ecological niche modeling. Here, we overcome this problem by using ecotypes, and not real species, to run our models. We created 40 ecotypes with different temperature requirements (mean temperature from -20 °C to 25 °C and temperature range from 10 °C to 40 °C) and used them to quantify the effect of climate change and human impact. Our results show that cold-adapted ecotypes would have been highly affected by past temperature changes in Europe, whereas temperate and warm-adapted ecotypes would have been positively affected by temperature change. Human impact affected all ecotypes negatively, and temperate ecotypes suffered the greatest impacts. Based on these results, the extinction of cold-adapted species like Mammuthus primigenius may be related to temperature change, while the extinction of temperate species, like Crocuta crocuta, may be related to human impact. Our results suggest that temperature change and human impact affected different ecotypes in distinct ways, and that the interaction of both impacts may have shaped species extinctions in Europe. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Climate change; Ecotypes; Extinction; Megafauna; Pleistocene; Range shift,"anthropogenic effect; climate variation; ecotype; extinction; mammal; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; range expansion; Europe; Crocuta crocuta; Mammalia; Mammuthus primigenius; animal; biological model; climate change; ecology; Europe; fossil; human; mammal; paleontology; species extinction; temperature; Animals; Climate Change; Ecology; Europe; Extinction, Biological; Fossils; Humans; Mammals; Models, Biological; Paleontology; Temperature",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924370711,,FALSE,*

This time interval is also marked by a global geochemical perturbation of δ13C with a negative excursion at the Aalenian/Bajocian boundary and a positive excursion during the early Bajocian. Evolutionary diversifications of marine invertebrate taxa, namely ammonites, radiolarians, and coccolithophorids, are recorded at that time. Concerning coccolithophorids, this interval witnesses the diversification and expansion of the most successful Mesozoic genus: Watznaueria. In this study, we explore the potential environmental, ecological, and biological forcing at the origin of Watznaueria diversification and its effect on the coccolith assemblages through quantification of the absolute and relative abundances of calcareous nannofossils in two Middle Jurassic key sections: Cabo Mondego (Portugal) and Chaudon-Norante (France). In both sections, we find an increase in nannofossil absolute abundance and flux at the beginning of the lower Bajocian, coeval with an increase in absolute and relative abundances of Watznaueria spp., followed by a plateau in the middle and upper part of the lower Bajocian. The increase of Watznaueria spp. is synchronous with a decrease in relative abundance of other major coccolith taxa, whereas the absolute abundance of these species did not decrease. During the climatically driven early Bajocian eutrophication event, Watznaueria spp. integrated into the calcareous nannoplankton community in two successive evolutionary steps involving first W. contracta and W. colaccicchii, and second W. britannica and W. aff. manivitiae. Step 1 was driven by an increase in niche carrying capacities linked to the early Bajocian eutrophication. Step 2 was driven by specific adaptation of the newly evolved Watznaueria species to bloom in nutrient-rich environments not exploited before.

Although developed by biologists and used extensively in the modern, ENM is in its early stages of application to the deep-time fossil record (hence PaleoENM). In part its limited use in the fossil record thus far reflects the methodological challenge of constructing paleoenvironmental layers needed for PaleoENM analysis, whereas in the modern these layers are available from large public databases (e.g., WorldClim).

For example, the tropical-temperate diversity gradient for woody angiosperms should reflect the tropical, older origin of most clades, the constrained evolution of cold tolerance, and the fact that few clades were able to persist in temperate zones after the beginning of the global cooling in the Eocene. Evidence for this explanation has been discussed primarily from a Northern Hemisphere perspective. Recently, two studies have presented diversity and clade-age relationships in South American forests that are inconsistent with the TCH, with older woody families being more frequent at higher latitudes and higher elevations in the Andes. We argue that a broader framework considering the ancient history of the Southern Hemisphere flora and the recent history of the Andean flora can help explain these discordant patterns. Here, we provide an initial discussion of this new perspective, emphasizing the historical development of a unique and rich palaeoflora of Gondwanan ancestry at mid- to high latitudes of South America and Antarctica.

Specifically, we tested two alternative hypotheses: (1) that areas with high habitat suitability and stability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sustain higher effective population sizes, resulting in increased levels of genetic diversity; and (2) that populations from areas with lower habitat stability show higher levels of genetic admixture due to their recurrent colonization by individuals originating from genetically differentiated populations. Furthermore, we analysed the relative importance of past and current habitat suitability and their additive effects on contemporary patterns of genetic structure. Location: California, USA. Methods: We sampled 160 individuals from 33 localities across the distribution range of the canyon live oak in California and then combined information from 13 nuclear microsatellite DNA markers and climate niche modelling to study patterns of genetic variation in this species. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to analyse geographical patterns of genetic structure and admixture, and circuit theory to generate isolation-by-resistance (IBR) distance matrices. Results: We found that the degree of genetic admixture was higher in localities with lower inferred population stability, but that genetic diversity was not associated with habitat suitability or stability. Landscape genetic analyses identified habitat stability as the primary driver of population genetic differentiation. Main conclusions: This study shows that habitat stability can be a major factor shaping genetic variation in wind-pollinated trees and supports the idea that stable regions contribute to genetic connectivity across different climatic periods. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report an association between patterns of genetic admixture and stability of local habitat. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Quercus chrysolepis; California; Climatic stability; Ecological niche modelling; Gene flow; Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Interglacial refugia; Palaeodistribution modelling,canyon; colonization; deciduous forest; gene flow; genetic structure; genetic variation; Last Glacial Maximum; niche partitioning; paleobiogeography; prediction; refugium; California; United States; Quercus chrysolepis,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920989668,,FALSE,

As world demand for energy rises, renewable energy (RE) has a significant potential to mitigate global climate change, address regional and local environmental concerns, reduce poverty, and increase energy security. The main focus toward RE mainstreaming has, thus far, been oriented toward technology development. High capital costs and dependence on government subsidies have deterred investors. New and innovative business models have now emerged where these technologies can capture new niche markets by focusing on demand with supportive policy regimes. The papers in Part IV of this book (Chaps. 13-15) establish the feasibility of RE production and use when evaluated more comprehensively, going beyond a direct cost-benefit analysis and including environmental and climate-related externalities of traditional fossil fuel-based energy use.

Our aim was to evaluate the role of the northern Andean high peaks and the low Magdalena Valley in creating barriers to dispersal and promoting vicariance within Rheobates. Location: Three disjunct mid-elevation flanks of the northern Colombian Andes: the eastern and western flanks of the Eastern Cordillera, separated by high mountain peaks, and the eastern flank of the Central Cordillera, separated from the Eastern Cordillera by the arid Magdalena Valley. Methods: We analysed mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from 37 individuals of Rheobates to infer their phylogenetic relationships, divergence times and ancestral areas. We used species distribution models to test the role of climatic variables in determining the present geographical boundaries of the species. Results: The phylogeny of Rheobates is largely predicted by geography, with one population from the eastern flank of the Eastern Cordillera sharing a most recent common ancestor with all other Rheobates 21 million years ago (Ma; 95% credible interval 31-10 Ma). Populations in the Central Cordillera were monophyletic, isolated across the Magdalena Valley with a divergence time estimated at 13 Ma (19-7 Ma). We also detected one recent crossing of the Eastern Cordillera, along with unanticipated latitudinal phylogeographical structure within the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera. Environmental niche tests indicated that the Magdalena Valley and the high peaks of the Eastern Cordillera are significant environmental barriers for Rheobates populations. Main conclusions: Diversification in Rheobates coincided with the early Miocene uplift of Colombia's Eastern Cordillera and the hypothesized onset of aridity in the Magdalena Valley during the middle Miocene. Our study offers broad support for the classic mountain orogeny model of vicariant divergence, but suggests that lowland habitat heterogeneity also played a long-term role in promoting vicariance, despite a long history of palaeoclimatic fluctuations. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Rheobates; Andean uplift; Colombia; Divergence times; Miocene; Molecular phylogenetics; Niche conservatism; Phylogeography; Species tree; Vicariance,Anura,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84915759939,,TRUE,

The fumaroles form habitats for extremophilic mosses and ferns. Physico-chemical measurements of two relatively pristine fumarolic microcosms point to their resemblance with the paleo-environment of earth during the Ordovician and Devonian periods. These geothermal habitats were analysed for the distribution of elemental mass fractions in the rhizospheric soil (RS), the native volcanic substrate (VS) and the sediments (S), using the new high-sensitivity technique of polarized x-ray energy dispersive fluorescence spectrometry (PEDXRF) as well as instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) for selected elements. This work presents the results for the naturally occurring heavy radioactive elements (NOHRE) Bi, Th and U but principally the latter two. For the RS, the density was found to be the least and the total organic matter content the most. Bi was found to be negligibly present in all substrate types. The average Th and U mass fractions in the RS were higher than in the VS and about equal to their average mass fractions in the S. The VS mass fraction of Th was higher, and of U lower, than the mass fractions in the earth's crust. In fact for the fumaroles of one site, the average RS mass fractions of these elements were higher than the averaged values for S (without considering the statistical dispersion). The immobilization of the NOHRE in the RS is brought about by the bio-geochemical processes specific to these extremophiles. Its effectiveness is such that despite the small masses of these plants, it compares with, or may sometimes exceed, the immobilization of the NOHRE in the S by the abiotic and aggressive chemical action of the hot-springs. These results indicate that the fumarolic plants are able to transform the volcanic substrate to soil and to affect the NOHRE mass fractions even though these elements are not plant nutrients. Mirrored back to the paleo times when such plant types were ubiquitous, it would mean that the first plants contributed significantly to pedogenesis and the biogeochemical recycling of even the heaviest and radioactive elements. Such plants may potentially be useful for the phytostabilisation of soil moderately contaminated by the NOHRE. Furthermore where applicable, geochronology may require taking into account the influence of the early plants on the NOHRE distributions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Bio-geochemistry; Fumarole; Geothermal; Ordovician; Thorium; Uranium,"Uranium; Fumarole; Geothermal; Los azufres; Me-xico; Naturally occurring; Ordovician; Volcanic complex; Thorium; actinide; bismuth; fresh water; organic matter; radioactive element; surface water; thorium; uranium; radioactive element; thorium; uranium; biogeochemistry; fumarole; geothermal system; microcosm; neutron activation analysis; Ordovician; paleoenvironment; physicochemical property; radioactive waste; soil pollution; thermal spring; thorium isotope; uranium isotope; Article; chemical composition; clubmoss; Devonian; ecological niche; Embryophyta; fern; geochemistry; geothermal microcosm; high temperature; light intensity; limit of detection; Lycopodium; mass; Mexico; microclimate; microcosm; moisture; moss; nonhuman; Ordovician; particle size; pedogenesis (soil); plant; plant community; plant nutrient; rhizosphere; sediment; temperature; thermal spring; vascular plant; water temperature; water vapor; weathering; ecosystem; Los Azufres; Mexico [North America]; Michoacan; Ecosystem; Ecosystem; Elements, Radioactive; Elements, Radioactive; Mexico; Mexico; Thorium; Thorium; Uranium; Uranium",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908249983,,FALSE,

Community assembly depends on the availability of species in a regional species pool (a ""biota""), which itself is assembled through a history of diversification, geographic range shifting, and adaptive responses to environmental change. The Great Basin contains a diverse mammal biota sorted into communities along elevational, latitudinal, and structural habitat gradients. Molecular genetic approaches have clarified the timing of diversification events in response to dynamic Neogene landscapes in several iconic Great Basin mammals, although the role of Great Basin landscape evolution on species diversification remains largely unexplored. Divergence continued into the Quaternary, as widespread species formed genetically unique lineages in and around the Great Basin. In response to Quaternary climatic oscillation, some mammalian species maintained their ranges whereas others exhibited dramatic range contractions or expansions, impacting the composition of regional species pools available for local community assembly. Advances will come from elucidating phylogenetic and phylogeographic structure in more taxa, but also from emerging genomic and modeling approaches to address how ecological traits, niche shifts, and adaptive evolution have influenced specific responses to dynamic landscapes and climates resulting in the species assemblages that characterize the Great Basin. © 2014 American Society of Mammalogists.",climate change; cryptic lineage; cryptic species; geomorphology; intermontane region; North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA); phylogeography; range expansion; range shifting; refuge,environmental response; fossil record; genetic variation; mammal; molecular analysis; Neogene; phylogeny; range expansion; Great Basin; United States; Mammalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920389180,,FALSE,*

Because of the central importance of ecological niches, they have been assumed to remain relatively stable during intervals of morphological stasis. However, the assumption of niche stability has rarely been tested directly with fossil data spanning multiple temporal intervals. Thus, the conditions under which this assumption is likely to be accurate are not well understood. In this study, we use ecological niche modeling (ENM) to reconstruct the ecological niche for 11 genera of marine benthos (crinoids, trilobites, molluscs, bryozoans, and corals) from the Type Cincinnatian Series (Late Ordovician, Katian Stage) across nine temporal intervals spanning approximately three million years. This interval includes both abiotic environmental change (gradual sea-level fall) and biotic change (rapid pulses of the Richmondian Invasion), thus allowing the relative effect of different environmental perturbations to be constrained. A previous symmetrical analysis of niche stability of brachiopod species recovered an increase in niche evolution following the Richmondian Invasion. Herein we test the generality of the brachiopod pattern within the community. Niche stability was evaluated in geographic space, ecological space, and niche parameter space. Niche stability varied through time; during the Pre-Invasion interval, taxa exhibited niche stability during gradual shallowing of sea level in the basin, whereas niche evolution became more common during the Richmondian Invasion. Taxa adjusted to the increased competition by altering aspects of their niche. Notably, surviving taxa contracted their niche into a subset of their previous niche parameters. This represents an adaptive response to increased competition for resources with the newly established invader taxa, and it was employed most successfully by generalist taxa. Patterns of niche evolution were congruent between clades, among feeding styles, and across taxonomic levels. © 2014 The Paleontological Society.

Given the systemic reach of much senior decision making, including decisions that constrain their own actions, there is an urgent need to open up the SDM black box. Focused on Western governments and multinational corporations, this article examines a cross-disciplinary range of literature to ask: What are the key factors affecting the preparedness of SDMs-particularly those who accept the climate science-to take the decisive actions needed to drive rapid and significant emission reductions? The review brings together multiple perspectives on the many compounding factors operating across three interconnected scales: micro (individual and interpersonal factors including disciplinary background, worldview, gender, and risk perceptions); meso (network, organizational and institutional factors including management paradigms, organizational culture, and institutional complexity); and macro (environmental, social, cultural, political, and economic factors including climatic extremes, vested interests, and public opinion). It concludes that SDMs are strongly focused on their 'local' professional context and near-term pressures, including reputation among peers, relationships with competitors, and real-time financial status. As a group they exist within a largely closed circuit and perceive the world from a particular narrow perspective. Combined with the complexity and embedded character of existing systems, this occludes more systemic or reflexive thinking or action.

Location: A 5000-m elevational gradient in the Hengduan Mountains, China. Methods: By means of a dated phylogenetic tree and reconstructed ancestral states, we estimated elevation-specific diversification rate, applied a new method to estimate colonization frequency and age and, for the first time, modelled historical species richness patterns that take account of temporal patterns of palaeotemperature. As explanations for current richness patterns, we assessed area, geometric constraints, temperature, precipitation, seasonality and productivity. Results: The current elevational pattern of species richness is a hump-shaped curve with a peak at about 1000-2500m. The reconstructed palaeopatterns of species richness suggest that babblers, as a clade, first occupied the Hengduan Mountains at low to mid-elevations, although the method of ancestral state reconstruction cannot conclusively reject origins outside the current elevational distribution of the group. Diversification rates varied little along the elevational gradient, and thus cannot explain the richness pattern, but historical colonization frequency and colonization age were highly correlated with present-day species richness. Seasonality and productivity had greater power than area and geometric constraints in explaining the present-day richness pattern of babblers along the elevational gradient. Conclusions: Historical and modern factors have both played important roles in shaping species richness patterns.

We assess the capacity of these models to predict species distributions under conditions that differ from the current environment by testing whether they can predict past distributions of species. Location: From 43°S to 31°S in south-eastern Australia (including Tasmania). Methods: We studied three dominant tree species of temperate Australian mesic forests, Atherosperma moschatum, Eucalyptus regnans and Nothofagus cunninghamii. Phylogeographic evidence indicates that these species each survived the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in multiple refugia. We modelled the current distribution of each species and projected those models onto LGM climates under six palaeoclimatic scenarios. The support for phylogeographic-based glacial refugia was estimated under each scenario using three different thresholds for inferring species presence/absence. Results: The LGM models under scenarios that allowed for a realistic level of rainfall failed to predict survival of the study species in refugia identified from genetic evidence, apart from those in perhumid western Tasmania. Main conclusions: Correct prediction of nearly all modern occurrences of the species suggests that this failure of ENMs to predict refugial survival was not methodological. Rather we conclude that the existing realized niches of these species may have changed since the LGM. Such niche changes may have involved the occurrence of non-analogue climates in the LGM and some significant alteration of fundamental niche (for at least E.regnans). Our results emphasize that predictions of future impacts of climate change on biodiversity will benefit from awareness of the limitations of ENMs in predicting the extinction of populations/species. Greater knowledge of how niches have changed through time and how this relates to the characteristics of species is needed to improve the reliability of ENMs. Niche changes in plants may also affect palaeoclimatic estimates based on fossil pollen. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Climate change; Climatic niche; Ecological niche models; Existing niche; General circulation model; Last glacial maximum; Non-analogue climates; Phylogeography,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908473081,,TRUE,

An extreme example of this is the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation, which was dominated by sauropod dinosaurs, the largest known terrestrial vertebrates. High sauropod diversity within the resource-limited Morrison is paradoxical, but might be explicable through sophisticated resource partitioning. This hypothesis was tested through finite-element analysis of the crania of the Morrison taxa Camarasaurus and Diplodocus. Results demonstrate divergent specialization, with Camarasaurus capable of exerting and accommodating greater bite forces than Diplodocus, permitting consumption of harder food items. Analysis of craniodental biomechanical characters taken from 35 sauropod taxa demonstrates a functional dichotomy in terms of bite force, cranial robustness and occlusal relationships yielding two polyphyletic functional ‘grades’. Morrison taxa are widely distributed within and between these two morphotypes, reflecting distinctive foraging specializations that formed a biomechanical basis for niche partitioning between them. This partitioning, coupled with benefits associated with large body size, would have enabled the high sauropod diversities present in the Morrison Formation. Further, this provides insight into the mechanisms responsible for supporting the high diversities of large megaherbivores observed in other Mesozoic and Cenozoic communities, particularly those occurring in resource-limited environments. © 2014 The Authors.",Biomechanics; Finite-element analysis; Megaherbivores; Morrison formation; Niche partitioning; Sauropod,biomechanics; Cenozoic; cranium; dinosaur; divergence; energy use; finite element method; Jurassic; niche partitioning; resource scarcity; sedimentary rock; species richness; Sauropoda; anatomy and histology; animal; biodiversity; biomechanics; dinosaur; ecosystem; finite element analysis; fossil; physiology; skull; Animals; Biodiversity; Biomechanical Phenomena; Dinosaurs; Ecosystem; Finite Element Analysis; Fossils; Skull,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908144103,,FALSE,

We assess whether onshore–offshore gradients in long-term turnover between the tropical Eocene and the warm-temperate Plio-Pleistocene can be extrapolated from gradients in short-term turnover, using abundances of molluscan species from bulk samples in the northeast Atlantic Province. We find that temporal turnover of metacommunities does not significantly decline with depth over short durations (less than 5 Myr), but significantly declines with depth between the Eocene and Plio-Pleistocene (approx. 50 Myr). This decline is determined by a higher onshore extinction of Eocene genera and families, by a higher onshore variability in abundances of genera and families, and by an onshore expansion of genera and families that were frequent offshore in the Eocene. Onshore–offshore decline in turnover thus emerges only over long temporal durations.We suggest that this emergence is triggered by abrupt and spatially extensive climatic or oceanographic perturbations that occurred between the Eocene and Plio-Pleistocene. Plio-Pleistocene metacommunities show a high proportion of bathymetric generalists, in contrast to Eocene metacommunities. Accordingly, the net cooling and weaker thermal gradients may have allowed offshore specialists to expand into onshore habitats and maintain their presence in offshore habitats. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We additionally investigate whether these species’ upper and lower thermal tolerances are constrained across this interval.

The bases for these radiations have been ascribed to geographic isolation, abiotic and biotic differences between populations, and/or hybridization and polyploidization. The Cordilleran Campanula L. (Campanulaceae Juss.), a monophyletic clade of mostly endemic arctic-alpine taxa from western North America, experienced a recent and rapid radiation. We set out to unravel the factors that likely influenced speciation in this group. To do so, we integrated environmental, genetic, and morphological datasets, tested biogeographic hypotheses, and analyzed the potential consequences of the various factors on the evolutionary history of the clade. We created paleodistribution models to identify potential Pleistocene refugia for the clade and estimated niche space for individual taxa using geographic and climatic data. Using 11 nuclear loci, we reconstructed a species tree and tested biogeographic hypotheses derived from the paleodistribution models. Finally, we tested 28 morphological characters, including floral, vegetative, and seed characteristics, for their capacity to differentiate taxa. Our results show that the combined effect of Quaternary climatic variation, isolation among differing environments in the mountains in western North America, and biotic factors influencing floral morphology contributed to speciation in this group during the mid-Pleistocene. Furthermore, our biogeographic analyses uncovered asynchronous consequences of interglacial and glacial periods for the timing of refugial isolation within the southern and northwestern mountains, respectively. These findings have broad implications for understanding the processes promoting speciation in arctic-alpine plants and the rise of numerous endemic taxa across the region. © 2014 The Authors.",Arctic-alpine plants; Ecological niche modeling; Morphology; Pacific northwest; Quaternary; Statistical phylogeography,Campanula; Campanulaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939136683,,TRUE,

We systematically compare the differences between central European Neolithic archaeobotanical assemblages that have been preserved by charring compared to those preserved by waterlogging. Charred archaeobotanical assemblages possess on aggregate about 35% of the range of edible plants documented in waterlogged samples from wetland settlements. We control for the ecological availability of wetland versus terrestrial wild plant foods on assemblage composition and diversity, and demonstrate that the significantly broader range of wild plant food taxa represented is primarily a function of preservation rather than subsistence practices. We then consider whether observed fluctuations in the frequency of edible wild taxa over time can also be attributed to preservation, and demonstrate that it cannot; and thus conclude that there are significant changes in plant food diets during the Neolithic that reflect different strategies of land use and, over time, a decreasing reliance on foraging for wild plant foods. The wild species included in our analyses are not spatially restricted-they are common throughout central Europe. We maintain, therefore, that our results are relevant beyond our study area and more generally illustrate the challenges of attempting to reconstruct the relative importance of wild plant foods-and thus plant diet breadth-in Neolithic archaeobotanical assemblages from charred data alone. © 2014 The Authors.",Central European Neolithic; Edible wild plants; Pile dwellings; Plant diet breadth; Preservation bias,Economics; Piles; Wetlands; Economics; Land use; Wetlands; Archaeological site; Assemblage composition; Central Europe; Central European Neolithic; Edible plants; Edible wild plants; Plant diet breadth; Under-represented; Nutrition; Piles; data set; edible species; Neolithic; niche breadth; paleobotany; paleoecology; preservation; subsistence; wild population; archaeological evidence; archaeology; diet; fossil assemblage; human settlement; pile; sampling; Europe,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907352218,,FALSE,

However, the paleoecology of both species needs to be better understood to enlighten why these species disappear in the end of the Pleistocene, an issue that is still debated. During the last decades, the carbon and oxygen stable isotopes have been increasingly being used to obtain paleoecological information about extinct animals, although this information is in most cases dissociated from chronological data. Thus, the main objective of this study is to contribute to the knowledge about feeding ecology and chronology of E.laurillardi and N.platensis within BIR. For each fossil sample we performed stable isotopes analyses (δ13C/δ18O) and radiocarbon dating (14C with AMS). The results showed that N.platensis occurred between 12,125 and 19,594calyr BP and exhibited a grazer diet (δ13C=-1.1‰-1.3‰), while E.laurillardi lived between 11,084 and 27,690calyr BP, with a mixed feeder diet (C3/C4 plants; values ratio δ13C=-7.7‰ to-3.3‰). The δ18O values of N.platensis ranged between 2.20‰ and 3.60‰, while the values of E.laurillardi ranged between-3.10‰ and-1.10‰. Neither species did exhibit differences in its diet through time, which suggests that the vegetational composition of this locality did not vary in the late Pleistocene.

Small mammals, especially Plio-Pleistocene arvicolids (voles and lemmings), are particularly suited for such studies because they have an unusually complete fossil record and exhibit significant evolutionary change through time. In recent decades, arvicolids have been the focus of intensive research devoted to the tempo and mode of evolutionary change and the identification of trends in dental evolution that can be used to correlate and date fossil sites. These studies have raised interesting questions about whether voles and lemmings had unique evolutionary trajectories, or show convergent evolutionary patterns with other hypsodont rodents. Here we review evolutionary patterns in selected arvicolid lineages and endemic Messinian murids (Mikrotia spp.) and discuss reasons for convergence in dental morphology in these two groups of hypsodont rodents. The results substantiate previously detected patterns, but the larger dataset shows that some trends are less regular than previous studies have suggested. With the exception of a pervasive and sustained trend towards increased hypsodonty, our results show that other features do not follow consistent patterns in all lineages, exhibiting a mosaic pattern comprising stasis, variable rate evolution and gradual unidirectional change through time. Evidence for higher evolutionary rates is found in lineages apparently undergoing adaptations to new ecological niches. In the case of Mikrotia, Microtus voles and the water vole (Mimomys-A. rvicola) lineage, a shift to a fossorial lifestyle appears to have been an important driving force in their evolution. For other characters, different causes can be invoked; for example a shift to a semi-aquatic lifestyle may be responsible for the trend towards increasing size in Arvicola.

This paper takes a quantitative approach to investigate some of the claims made in this discussion.

In the present study, the biomass fraction of artificially made RDF was determined by means of the SDM (selective dissolution method) in total carbon basis and also by the 14C method in total carbon, weight and calorific value bases. Then the relative accuracy was compared using findings from a previous study. SDM shows very high accuracy in weight and calorific value basis.

A highly hypercarnivorous dentition of the new fox bears a striking resemblance to that of V. lagopus and substantially predates the previous oldest records of the arctic fox by 3-4 Myr. The low latitude, high-altitude Tibetan Plateau is separated from the nearest modern arctic fox geographical range by at least 2000 km. The apparent connection between an ancestral high-elevation species and its modern polar descendant is consistent with our 'Out-of-Tibet' hypothesis postulating that high-altitude Tibet was a training ground for cold-environment adaptations well before the start of the Ice Age. © 2014 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

This would suggest that such patterns are strongly determined by global abiotic factors, such as climate, or by basic eco-evolutionary processes such as filling of niches by specialization. The similarity of pattern would be expected to extend to the history of individual clades. Here, we investigate the temporal distribution of maximum size observed within individual orders globally and on separate continents. While the maximum size of individual orders of large land mammals show differences and comprise several families, the times at which orders reach their maximum size over time show strong congruence, peaking in the Middle Eocene, the Oligocene and the Plio-Pleistocene. The Eocene peak occurs when global temperature and land mammal diversity are high and is best explained as a result of niche expansion rather than abiotic forcing. Since the Eocene, there is a significant correlation between maximum size frequency and global temperature proxy. The Oligocene peak is not statistically significant and may in part be due to sampling issues. The peak in the Plio-Pleistocene occurs when global temperature and land mammal diversity are low, it is statistically the most robust one and it is best explained by global cooling. We conclude that the macroevolutionary patterns observed are a result of the interplay between eco-evolutionary processes and abiotic forcing. © 2014 The Author(s).",Body size; Cenozoic; Evolution; Macroecology; Mammals; Maximum size frequency,"body size; Cenozoic; evolutionary biology; macroecology; mammal; paleoecology; specialization; species diversity; altitude; animal; Anura; climate change; physiology; Puerto Rico; season; tropic climate; vocalization; Altitude; Animals; Anura; Climate Change; physiology; Puerto Rico; Seasons; Tropical Climate; Vocalization, Animal",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898670961,,FALSE,

Despite its prominence and ecological importance, the origins and assembly of the reef fish fauna is poorly described. A patchy fossil record suggests that the major colonization of reef habitats must have occurred in the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene, with the earliest known modern fossil coral reef fish assemblage dated to 50 Ma. Using a phylogenetic approach, we analysed the early evolutionary dynamics of modern reef fishes. We find that reef lineages successively colonized reef habitats throughout the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene. Twowaves of invasionwere accompanied by increasing morphological convergence: one in the Late Cretaceous from 90 to 72 Ma and the other immediately following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. The surge in reef invasions after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary continued for 10 Myr, after which the pace of transitions to reef habitats slowed. Combined, these patterns match a classic niche-filling scenario: early transitions to reefs were made rapidly by morphologically distinct lineages and were followed by a decrease in the rate of invasions and eventual saturation of morphospace. Major alterations in reef composition, distribution and abundance, along with shifts in climate and oceanic currents, occurred during the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene interval. A causal mechanism between these changes and concurrent episodes of reef invasion remains obscure, but what is clear is that the broad framework of the modern reef fish fauna was in place within 10 Myr of the end-Cretaceous extinction. © 2014 The Authors.",Cretaceous-Palaeogene mass extinction; Macroevolution; Niche-filling models; Reef fishes,"colonization; colony founding; Cretaceous; fish; fossil record; niche; Paleogene; reef; animal; animal communication; color vision; courtship; female; male; mate choice; physiology; sexual behavior; songbird; Animal Communication; Animals; Color Perception; Courtship; Female; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; physiology; physiology; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Songbirds",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902668712,,FALSE,

We compared the network structure of Messel lake and forest foodwebs to extantwebs using analyses that account for scaledependence of structure with diversity and complexity. The Messel lake web, with 94 taxa, displays unambiguous similarities in structure to extant webs. While the Messel forest web, with 630 taxa, displays differences compared to extant webs, they appear to result from high diversity and resolution of insect-plant interactions, rather than substantive differences in structure. The evidence presented here suggests that modern trophic organization developed along with the modern Messel biota during an 18 Myr interval of dramatic post-extinction change.

These habitats (hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, reducing sediment) are home to bacteria and archaea acting as primary producers using the energy obtained by oxidizing reducing compounds in fluids (e.g., H2S and hydrocarbons such as CH4) to synthesize organic matter. Such sites may make a large microbial biomass available to consumers and promote the development of complex symbiotic relationships between prokaryotes and hosting eukaryotes. Shallow water (&lt;200 m) chemosynthetic niches are pervasive in the Mediterranean where reduced sediment are present (lagoons, seagrass beds, prodeltaic settings etc.) being exploited primarily by sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, some of which are symbiotic with metazoans. Particular cases of shallow chemosynthetic habitats are hydrothermal vents, submarine caves with sulphur springs, cold seeps including active pockmarks and reducing sediments in areas of high organic deposition. Deep-water chemosynthetic habitats (&gt;200 m) with also metazoans with chemoautotrophic symbionts are present at various sites in the Mediterranean, encompassing both cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. Cold seeps are diffuse and geologically diverse, and comprise mud volcanoes, brine pools and active pockmark fields, whose reducing environments are often exploited by endemic chemosymbiotic metazoans, including bivalves and siboglinid polychaetes. Such environments are clustered in the Eastern Mediterranean (Nile Deep Sea Fan, Anaximander mud volcano field, Olimpi mud volcano field, Eratosthenes Seamount, Calabrian Arc, Marmara deep fault systems) but equally occur in the Strait of Sicily, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian and Alboran Seas. Deep hyperhaline anoxic basins occur in the Eastern Mediterranean and even host metazoans that live in anoxic conditions. Deep-water hydrothermal vents characterized by microbial communities and metazoans (siboglinid polychaetes) are documented so far only from some Tyrrhenian seamounts (Marsili, Palinuro) and Aegean submerged volcanic craters (Santorini, Kolumbo). The geo-biological relevance of such complex habitats often situated in the high seas, calls for an international effort towards the implementation of proper protection and sustainable management. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Multiple types of data drawn from disparate fields, combined into a single modelling framework, are necessary to document changes in a species's demography and distribution, and to determine the drivers responsible for change. Yet truly integrated approaches are challenging and rarely performed. Here, we discuss a modelling framework that integrates spatio-temporal fossil data, ancient DNA, palaeoclimatological reconstructions, bioclimatic envelope modelling and coalescence models in order to statistically test alternative hypotheses of demographic and potential distributional changes for the iconic American bison (Bison bison). Using different assumptions about the evolution of the bioclimatic niche, we generate hypothetical distributional and demographic histories of the species. We then test these demographic models by comparing the genetic signature predicted by serial coalescence against sequence data derived from subfossils and modern populations. Our results supported demographic models that include both climate and human-associated drivers of population declines. This synthetic approach, integrating palaeoclimatology, bioclimatic envelopes, serial coalescence, spatio-temporal fossil data and heterochronous DNA sequences, improves understanding of species' historical biogeogra-phy by allowing consideration of both abiotic and biotic interactions at the population level.© 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

A recent checklist of fossil and living plants and animals in terrestrial and marine ecosystems highlights spectacular local radiations coupled with unusual ecological niches and an amazing array of cryptic diversity across most habitats. Although New Zealand and Australia share common biotic antecedents, for the past 20 million years the New Zealand terrestrial biota has occupied constantly mesic habitats but has undergone major extinctions as climate cooled. On land, plants and animals have diversified in non-forest ecosystems, particularly shrublands and grasslands. New Zealand faces major challenges in protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services, in part because the biota is adjusting to relatively recent human occupation, and land use and marine harvesting are intensifying. Models for effective conservation in terrestrial environments are dependent on enduring predator control, legislative protection of remaining indigenous habitats and threatened species, and novel approaches that compensate land owners for contributing towards national biodiversity outcomes. Marine protected areas are minimal in extent although managed fish quota systems appear to be sustaining some species. Indigenous biodiversity in New Zealand remains vulnerable especially in ecosystems dominated by human activities. Introduction New Zealand is often compared to an Ark, laden with a unique Gondwanan biota. While this emphasises remoteness and antiquity as major drivers of our biotic distinctiveness, it less adequately captures the composite elements of the biota or the complex history of immigration, extinction and speciation, and a changing geography and climate during the Cenozoic in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. All of these factors have contributed to the evolution of an overwhelmingly endemic idiosyncratic biota that continues to adjust to natural environmental change and more recent anthropogenic impacts. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953750045,,FALSE,

Case study one determines the level of genetic diversity and structure within naturally occurring populations of Podocarpus elatus and resolves the influence of historic and contemporary drivers on divergence. Case study two explores the impact of glacial cycle climatic changes on the palaeodistribution of the species: by combining population genetic analysis, coalescent-based analysis, the observed fossil record and environmental niche modeling. Case study three hypothesizes that future adaptive potential is indicative of genetic/demographic change and range expansion/contraction trends in Podocarpus elatus associated with the Clarence River Corridor.

In considering this paradox it is important to understand that benefits and threats may not always be apparent in equal measure throughout the potential range of each candidate biofuel species. In some environments, a species could potentially produce valuable biological materials without posing a significant invasion threat. In this study, we develop a bioclimatic niche model for a candidate biofuel crop, Millettia pinnata, and apply the model to different climatic and irrigation scenarios to estimate the current and future patterns of climate suitability for its growth and naturalization. We use Australia as a case study for interpreting the niche model in terms that may be informative for both biofuels proponents and biosecurity regulators to plan management programmes that reflect the invasive potential in different areas. The model suggests that suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata in Australia are naturally restricted to the moist and semimoist tropics. Irrigation can extend the suitable growing conditions more widely throughout the tropics, and into more arid regions. Under future climate scenarios, suitable growing conditions for M. pinnata under natural rainfall contract towards the east coast, and extend southward into the subtropics. With irrigation, M. pinnata appears to have the potential in the future to naturalize across much of Australia. The bioclimatic modelling method demonstrated here is comparatively quick and easy, and can produce a rich array of data products to inform the interests of both bioenergy proponents and biosecurity regulators. We show how this modelling can support the development of spatially explicit biosecurity policies designed to manage invasion risks in a manner that balances bioenergy and biosecurity concerns. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biosecurity; CLIMEX; Invasive alien species; Millettia pinnata; Niche model; Oilseed tree; Pongamia pinnata,Biofuels; Biological materials; Climate change; Crops; Fossil fuels; Irrigation; Risk assessment; Tropics; Bio-security; CLIMEX; Invasive alien species; Millettia pinnata; Pongamia pinnata; Climate models,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905246206,,FALSE,

We forecast how marine molluscan faunas might respond to environmental change over the remainder of this century. We test the hypotheses that suitable areas will shift northwards for studied species, and that species will show varied responses to future climate change. Location: North and South America and the Caribbean. Methods: We generated ecological niche models (in GARP and Maxent) for 14 ecologically, economically and potentially medically important mollusc species, using present-day summaries and future forecasts of climate from the Hadley Centre and known species occurrence data from natural history collections. Niche models were used to forecast potential distributions according to three scenarios of future change for three time slices. Results: Northern extremes of suitability are predicted to shift northwards for only three (GARP) or four (Maxent) of the 14 species, whereas the southern edge of suitability is predicted to shift southwards for seven (GARP) and one (Maxent) of the 14 species. When changes in the geographical centroids of suitability are considered, no significant poleward shifts are anticipated for individual species. Instead, half of the study species (many economically important) experience substantial (> 20%) loss of suitable environmental area, even under the lowest-emission future climate scenario. Furthermore, the direction and magnitude of the response to predicted climate change is species-specific. Main conclusions: We do not find a coherent pattern of areas with suitable environments expanding at high-latitude range boundaries, with simultaneous contraction at their low-latitude boundaries. Tropical marine molluscs may thus show varied responses as average temperatures warm. These results contrast with trends among terrestrial and other marine species, which are rapidly shifting their ranges to higher latitudes. Conversely, the differing responses of these species to future warming are consistent with responses of species to past episodes of change, as observed in the fossil record. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Climate change; Crassostrea virginica; Ecological niche modelling; Extinction; Marine; Migration; Mollusca; Potential distribution; Range boundaries,climate change; community response; ecological modeling; future prospect; geographical distribution; hypothesis testing; latitude; local extinction; marine environment; migration; mollusc; niche; range expansion; range size; species occurrence; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Caribbean Islands; North America; South America; Crassostrea virginica; Mollusca,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902333446,,TRUE,?

Location: Intertidal shores along 1500km of the west coast of North America. Methods: Lethal temperatures for M.californianus were determined using temperature-controlled chambers in which both the magnitude and duration of exposure were manipulated. Field surveys of the shore level and solar exposure of upper zonation limits of mussel beds were conducted at 15 sites. Measurements from the lethal temperature studies and field surveys were used with a biophysical model of mussel body temperature to hindcast M.californianus mortality rates from 1997-2007. Results: The critical lethal high body temperature was c. 38°C. Hindcasts of mortality rates predicted that lethal temperatures occurred along the upper limits of the mussel bed at only two of the sites, Santa Cruz and Alegria, CA, USA, and daily maximum air temperature during low tide was the variable that distinguished these sites. Santa Cruz and Alegria were not adjacent to each other and not the most equatorward of the sites examined. Main conclusions: Local upper zonation limits of the mussel M.californianus are determined by lethal high body temperatures at two of 15 locations, which means that alternative environmental factors are determining local zonation at most of the study sites. Mussel body temperature is driven by many physical variables, but air temperature was higher at Santa Cruz and Alegria than elsewhere making it the most likely factor driving the climatic sensitivity at local upper zonation limits. There was no significant evidence of local acclimation or local adaptation in this species.

However, some plant species could have persisted during Quaternary climate oscillations without shifting their range, despite the limited evidence from fossils. Here, we tested two candidate mechanisms of persistence by comparing the macrorefugia and microrefugia (MR) hypotheses. We used the rare and endemic Saxifraga florulenta as a model taxon and combined ensembles of species distribution models (SDMs) with a high-resolution paleoclimatic and topographic dataset to reconstruct its potential current and past distribution since the last glacial maximum. To test the macrorefugia hypothesis, we verified whether the species could have persisted in or shifted to geographic areas defined by its realized niche. We then identified potential MR based on climatic and topographic properties of the landscape and applied refined scenarios of MR dynamics and functions over time. Last, we quantified the number of known occurrences that could be explained by either the macrorefugia or MR model. A consensus of two or three SDM techniques predicted absence between 14-10, 3-4 and 1 ka bp, which did not support the macrorefugia model. In contrast, we showed that S. florulenta could have contracted into MR during periods of absence predicted by the SDMs and later re-colonized suitable areas according to the macrorefugia model. Assuming a limited and realistic seed dispersal distance for our species, we explained a large number of the current occurrences (61-96%). Additionally, we showed that MR could have facilitated range expansions or shifts of S. florulenta. Finally, we found that the most recent and the most stable MR were the ones closest to current occurrences. Hence, we propose a novel paradigm to explain plant persistence by highlighting the importance of supporting functions of MR when forecasting the fate of plant species under climate change. © 2014 John Wiley.",Climate change; Hindcasting; Paleoclimate; Post-glacial re-colonization; Species distribution models,"climate variation; endemic species; hindcasting; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; paleotopography; plant; Quaternary; rare species; reconstruction; refugium; altitude; biological model; climate change; ecosystem; France; Italy; physiology; plant dispersal; Saxifragaceae; Altitude; Climate Change; Ecosystem; France; Italy; Models, Biological; Plant Dispersal; Saxifragaceae",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901836437,,TRUE,

To reliably predict at-risk species we need to know which species are currently responding, which are not, and what traits are mediating the responses. For mammals, we have yet to identify overarching physiological, behavioral, or biogeographic traits determining species' responses to climate change, but they must exist. To date, 73 mammal species in North America and eight additional species worldwide have been assessed for responses to climate change, including local extirpations, range contractions and shifts, decreased abundance, phenological shifts, morphological or genetic changes. Only 52% of those species have responded as expected, 7% responded opposite to expectations, and the remaining 41% have not responded. Which mammals are and are not responding to climate change is mediated predominantly by body size and activity times (phylogenetic multivariate logistic regressions, P < 0.0001). Large mammals respond more, for example, an elk is 27 times more likely to respond to climate change than a shrew. Obligate diurnal and nocturnal mammals are more than twice as likely to respond as mammals with flexible activity times (P < 0.0001). Among the other traits examined, species with higher latitudinal and elevational ranges were more likely to respond to climate change in some analyses, whereas hibernation, heterothermy, burrowing, nesting, and study location did not influence responses. These results indicate that some mammal species can behaviorally escape climate change whereas others cannot, analogous to paleontology's climate sheltering hypothesis. Including body size and activity flexibility traits into future extinction risk forecasts should substantially improve their predictive utility for conservation and management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Behavior; Elevation; Latitude; Mammal; Microclimate; Physiology; Thermal niches,"behavioral response; body size; climate change; elevation; extinction risk; forecasting method; global change; latitudinal gradient; mammal; microclimate; physiology; response analysis; North America; Mammalia; animal; animal behavior; body size; climate change; Europe; geography; mammal; motor activity; North America; phenotype; phylogeny; physiology; species difference; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Climate Change; Europe; Geography; Mammals; Motor Activity; North America; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Species Specificity",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900008895,,FALSE,

Modelling efforts to predict species distributions under future climates have increased with concern about the overall impact of these distribution shifts on species ecology, and especially where barriers to dispersal exist. Here we apply a bio-climatic envelope modelling technique to investigate the impacts of climate change on the geographic range of ten cetacean species in the eastern North Atlantic and to assess how such modelling can be used to inform conservation and management. The modelling process integrates elements of a species' habitat and thermal niche, and employs ""hindcasting"" of historical distribution changes in order to verify the accuracy of the modelled relationship between temperature and species range. If this ability is not verified, there is a risk that inappropriate or inaccurate models will be used to make future predictions of species distributions. Of the ten species investigated, we found that while the models for nine could successfully explain current spatial distribution, only four had a good ability to predict distribution changes over time in response to changes in water temperature. Applied to future climate scenarios, the four species-specific models with good predictive abilities indicated range expansion in one species and range contraction in three others, including the potential loss of up to 80% of suitable white-beaked dolphin habitat. Model predictions allow identification of affected areas and the likely time-scales over which impacts will occur. Thus, this work provides important information on both our ability to predict how individual species will respond to future climate change and the applicability of predictive distribution models as a tool to help construct viable conservation and management strategies. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Cetaceans; Conservation; Global climate change; Range changes; Species distribution modelling; Validating predictive models,"bioclimatology; cetacean; climate change; climate effect; global climate; hindcasting; sea surface temperature; spatial distribution; species conservation; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Cetacea; Lagenorhynchus; animal; animal dispersal; Atlantic Ocean; biological model; Cetacea; climate change; environmental protection; physiology; season; temperature; Animal Distribution; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Cetacea; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Models, Biological; Seasons; Temperature",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900008296,,TRUE,?

Four scenarios are discussed, in which alpha- and beta-diversity are modeled as a function of increasing gamma-diversity. The graphic illustration of this approach is herein called α-β-γ plot, in which the x-axis indicates increasing diversification rather than absolute time. In purely environmentally controlled systems, beta-diversity maintains near-maximum values throughout the diversification interval, whereas mean alpha-diversity increases linearly, with a slope being reciprocal to beta-diversity. A second scenario is based on the assumption that increasing richness will have predominantly positive effects on the addition of further species; here, alpha- and beta-diversity increase simultaneously (though not necessarily at the same rates) and without reaching a predictable upper limit. In ecosystems that are characterized by low competition between species, mean alpha-diversity asymptotically approaches a saturation level, whereas the increase in beta-diversity accelerates until alpha-diversity stagnates, and then continues to rise linearly. If competition is high, addition of species first increases beta-diversity until no further habitat contraction is possible, followed by a period in which alpha-diversity increase through adaptive divergence becomes the principal drive of diversification. Because there is a continuous transition between the late stage of the low-competition model and the early stage of the high-competition scenario, both can be combined in a single model of diversity partitioning under the premise of a diversity-dependent increase of competition. This summary model predicts three phases of diversity accumulation: (1) a niche overlap phase, (2) a habitat contraction phase, and (3) a niche differentiation phase. The models herein discussed provide a potential tool to assess the question which factors primary controlled the diversification of life over geological times. © 2014 The Paleontological Society.",,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899926297,,FALSE,

However, empirical evidence concerning the sensitivity of vertebrate community function to species loss is very limited. Here we assess documented prehistoric and historic extinctions of birds on Pacific islands in an effort to quantify the consequences of extinctions for functional structure and diversity in natural communities over broad spatial scales. Location: Forty-four islands from across the Pacific. Methods: We estimated functional aspects of island bird communities before and after Holocene extinctions based on body size, foraging niche, diet and activity period. We used four separate metrics to measure ecological function: functional diversity (FD), functional richness (FRic), functional evenness and functional divergence. We employed null models to separate the effects of observed extinctions from changes expected due to declining species richness. Results: We find that Holocene bird extinctions led to substantial changes in community-level functional diversity. Observed declines in FD and FRic were predictable from the pre-extinction composition of communities, and did not differ from null model expectations. Across all islands, we observed non-random changes in functional trait composition, with shifts away from ground-level foraging, granivory and herbivory after extinctions. Extinctions have resulted in the loss of up to 80% of original functional diversity on some islands and caused a sharp decrease in the variety of ecological functions provided by birds. Main conclusions: Our findings illustrate the significant losses of functional diversity that are already taking place on many islands and demonstrate its close connection with the loss of species. Accounting for the functional roles of species allows a more integrative understanding of ecological function and helps to bridge species and ecosystem perspectives in conservation science. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Biodiversity; Community assembly; Conservation; Ecosystem services; Functional diversity; Palaeoecology; Resilience,biodiversity; bird; community ecology; conservation management; ecological impact; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; extinction; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Aves; Vertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898545562,,FALSE,

But in most migration modelling approaches disturbance-driven succession and competition processes are reduced to simple assumptions or are even missing. The aim of this study was to test a combination of a migration model and a dynamic vegetation model to estimate the migration of tree species controlled by climate, environment and local species dynamics such as succession and competition. Location: Europe. Methods: To estimate the effect of vegetation dynamics on the migration of European beech and Norway spruce, we developed a post-process migration tool (LPJ-CATS). This tool integrates outputs of the migration model CATS and the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. The model LPJ-CATS relies on a linear dependency between the dispersal kernel and migration rate and is based on the assumption that competition reduces fecundity. Results: Simulating potential migration rates with the CATS model, which does not account for competition and disturbance, resulted in mean Holocene migration rates of 435±55 and 330±95m year-1 for the two species Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica, respectively. With LPJ-CATS, these mean migration rates were reduced to 250±75 and 170±60m year-1 for spruce and beech, respectively. Moreover, LPJ-CATS simulated migration pathways of these two species that generally comply well with those documented in the palaeo-records. Main conclusions: Our 'hybrid' modelling approach allowed for the simulation of generally realistic Holocene migration rates and pathways of the two study species on a continental scale. It suggests that competition can considerably modify spread rates, but also the magnitude of its effect depends on how close climate conditions are to the niche requirements of a particular species. © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",Climate change; Competition; DGVM; Fagus sylvatica; Holocene; Holocene migration; LPJ-CATS; Picea abies,climate conditions; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; ecological modeling; fecundity; Holocene; migration; paleoclimate; succession; vegetation dynamics; Europe; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Picea; Picea abies,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898545400,,FALSE,

Dynamic vegetation models are often used to assess the impact of climate on vegetation and model output can be compared with paleobotanical data as a reality check. Recent paleoecological studies have revealed regional variation in the upward shift of timberlines in the Northern and Central European Alps in response to rapid warming at the Younger Dryas/Preboreal transition ca. 11 700 years ago, probably caused by a climatic gradient across the Alps. This contrasts with previous studies that successfully simulated the early Holocene afforestation in the (warmer) Central Alps with a chironomid-inferred temperature reconstruction from the (colder) Northern Alps. We use LandClim, a dynamic landscape vegetation model to simulate mountain forests under different temperature, soil and precipitation scenarios around Iffigsee (2065 m a.s.l.) a lake in the Northwestern Swiss Alps, and compare the model output with the paleobotanical records. The model clearly overestimates the upward shift of timberline in a climate scenario that applies chironomid-inferred July-temperature anomalies to all months. However, forest establishment at 9800 cal. BP at Iffigsee is successfully simulated with lower moisture availability and monthly temperatures corrected for stronger seasonality during the early Holocene. The model-data comparison reveals a contraction in the realized niche of Abies alba due to the prominent role of anthropogenic disturbance after ca. 5000 cal. BP, which has important implications for species distribution models (SDMs) that rely on equilibrium with climate and niche stability. Under future climate projections, LandClim indicates a rapid upward shift of mountain vegetation belts by ca. 500 m and treeline positions of ca. 2500 m a.s.l. by the end of this century.

Palaeodistribution modelling and the fossil record might provide the spatial context for statistical phylogeographical analyses, allowing the generation of independent palaeoscenarios of demographic history that can be tested using coalescent models. In this study we generated independent demographic scenarios to examine geographical barriers to gene flow in a Neotropical swamp palm, Mauritia flexuosa, and assessed how climatic changes during the Pleistocene influenced its geographical distribution and genetic diversity. Location: Neotropical wetlands. Methods: We sampled 257 adult individuals of M. flexuosa from 26 localities in the Amazon, Araguaia/Tocantins, Paraguai, Paraná and São Francisco basins. The analyses were based on statistical phylogeography, ecological niche modelling and the fossil pollen record. The genetic data were based on polymorphisms in three chloroplast non-coding regions. Results: Mauritia flexuosa presented low genetic diversity but significant genetic differentiation among populations from different river basins. The ecological niche modelling and demographic simulations showed that the pattern of observed genetic diversity for M. flexuosa probably reflects range retraction during the Last Glacial Maximum, leading to multiple refugia. In support of this, the fossil pollen record suggests that multiple refugia were present in Brazilian savannas, where M. flexuosa often disappeared during cold and dry periods across the last glacial cycle, returning during the wet phases. The periodic dryness in this region was driven by the latitudinal displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) across glacial/interglacial periods, which possibly affected the distributional dynamics of M. flexuosa during the Pleistocene epoch. Main conclusions: Our results provide evidence that climate changes during the last glacial cycle were important determinants of the geographical distribution and demographic history of M. flexuosa across the late Quaternary period. In addition to the geographical barriers imposed by river basins, these factors have shaped genetic differentiation, as currently observed among lineages. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Amazonia; Arecaceae; Cerrado; Coalescence; Intertropical Convergence Zone; Mauritia flexuosa; Multiple refugia; Wetlands,cerrado; coalescence; demographic history; divergence; ecological modeling; evergreen tree; fossil record; genetic differentiation; intertropical convergence zone; Last Glacial Maximum; monocotyledon; Neotropical Region; niche partitioning; paleoecology; phylogeography; pollen; polymorphism; Quaternary; refugium; swamp; Amazon Basin; Amazonia; Araguaia Basin; Brazil; Paraguay Basin; Parana Basin; Sao Francisco Basin; Tocantins Basin; Arecaceae; Mauritia flexuosa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896116390,,TRUE,

This has severe implications for global climate change, and against this background, scholars within the sustainable transition tradition have taken an interest in addressing how transitions towards more sustainable development pathways in this region may be achieved. This paper contributes to the abovementioned literature by examining the conducive and limiting factors for development and proliferation of a palm oil biomass waste-to-energy niche in Malaysia during the period 1990-2011. Rising oil prices, strong pressure on the palm oil industry from environmental groups, and a persisting palm oil biomass waste disposal problem in Malaysia appear to have been conducive to niche proliferation, and on top of this national renewable energy policies and large-scale donor programmes have specifically supported the utilisation of palm oil biomass waste for energy. However, in spite of this, the niche development process has only made slow progress. The paper identifies reluctant implementation of energy policy, rise in biomass resource prices, limited network formation and negative results at the niche level, as the main factors hindering niche development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Biomass energy; Malaysia; Niche development,Biomass; Climate change; Costs; Crude oil price; Economics; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Petroleum industry; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Bio-mass energy; Development process; Environmental groups; Global climate changes; Malaysia; Niche development; Renewable energy policy; Sustainable energy; Palm oil; alternative energy; biomass power; energy policy; renewable resource; resource development; sustainable development; waste disposal; Malaysia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892477473,,FALSE,

We tested four predictions of how this should be manifested in the phylogenetic structure of 91,340 communities: (1) forests to the north should comprise species from younger clades (families) than forests to the south; (2) average cold tolerance at a local site should be associated with the mean family age (MFA) of species; (3) minimum temperature should account for MFA better than alternative environmental variables; and (4) traits associated with survival in cold climates should evolve under a niche conservatism constraint. Location: The contiguous United States. Methods: We extracted angiosperms from the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database. MFA was calculated by assigning age of the family to which each species belongs and averaging across the species in each community. We developed a phylogeny to identify phylogenetic signal in five traits: realized cold tolerance, seed size, seed dispersal mode, leaf phenology and height. Phylogenetic signal representation curves and phylogenetic generalized least squares were used to compare patterns of trait evolution against Brownian motion. Eleven predictors structured at broad or local scales were generated to explore relationships between environment and MFA using random forest and general linear models. Results: Consistent with predictions, (1) southern communities comprise angiosperm species from older families than northern communities, (2) cold tolerance is the trait most strongly associated with local MFA, (3) minimum temperature in the coldest month is the environmental variable that best describes MFA, broad-scale variables being much stronger correlates than local-scale variables, and (4) the phylogenetic structures of cold tolerance and at least one other trait associated with survivorship in cold climates indicate niche conservatism. Main conclusions: Tropical niche conservatism in the face of long-term climate change, probably initiated in the Late Cretaceous associated with the rise of the Rocky Mountains, is a strong driver of the phylogenetic structure of the angiosperm component of forest communities across the USA. However, local deterministic and/or stochastic processes account for perhaps a quarter of the variation in the MFA of local communities. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Forest phylogenetics; National Forest Inventory; Niche conservatism; North America; Phylogenetic signal representation; Random forests; Trait evolution; Tree communities; Tropical conservatism hypothesis,cladistics; climate variation; cold tolerance; community composition; forest inventory; fossil record; life history trait; niche partitioning; phylogenetics; plant community; seed dispersal; seed size; stand structure; North America; United States; Magnoliophyta,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890314292,,FALSE,?

Stratigraphically recurrent packages of distinct lithofacies, representing different habitats, contain qualitatively and quantitatively different macrofloras and microfloras. The species pools demonstrate niche conservatism, remaining closely tied to specific habitats, during both short-term cyclic environmental change and a longterm trend of increasing aridity. The deposits examined principally comprise the terrestrial Markley and its approximate marine equivalent, the Harpersville Formation and parts of lower Archer City Formation. Fossiliferous deposits are lens-like, likely representing fill sequences of channels formed during abandonment phases. Palaeosols, represented by blocky mudstones, comprise a large fraction of the deposits. They suggest progressive climate change from minimally seasonal humid to seasonal subhumid to seasonal dry subhumid. Five lithofacies yielded plants: kaolinite-dominated siltstone, organic shale, mudstone beds within organic shale, coarsening upward mudstone-sandstone interbeds and channel sandstone. Both macro- and microflora were examined. Lithofacies proved compositionally distinct, with different patterns of dominance diversity. Organic shales (swamp deposits), mudstone partings (swamp drainages) and coarsening upward mudstone-sandstone interbeds (floodplains) typically contain Pennsylvanian wetland vegetation. Kaolinite-dominated siltstones and (to the extent known) sandstones contain taxa indicative of seasonally dry substrates. Some kaolinite-dominated siltstones and organic shales/coals yielded palynomorphs. Microfloras are more diverse, with greater wetland-dryland overlap than macrofloras.

This study for the first time uses an integrated approach to explore the appropriateness of traditional classification by superposing quantitative characters on qualitative classification using advanced mathematical techniques. Here, a quantitative method was applied that calculates changes in body shape by digitizing the inferred ecological niche and functional attributes of relevant morphological traits. Subsequently, absolute values were assigned to structural-functional traits of extinct atrypids to determine their taxonomy at a higher resolution. Investigating phenotypic diversity in these once abundant Paleozoic brachiopods from deep time is important for predicting future marine biodiversity of their closest living relatives and in conserving the marine ecosystem at large. Results show taxonomic over-splitting, a possible consequence of qualitative taxonomy. This study highlights the necessity of revisiting prior taxonomy by incorporating quantified traits and elicits the hazards of proposing classification based on qualitative traits alone.

However, historical and evolutionary processes have also contributed to shape current diversity patterns. In this paper we focus on the potential influences of Pleistocene glaciation and phylogenetic niche conservatism (the tendency for traits to be maintained during diversification) on the tree diversity gradient in Chile, and we quantify its primary climatic correlates. Tree species richness is greatest at mid latitudes, particularly in the Andes and Coastal ranges, and decreases abruptly to the south and north. Regression tree analysis identified annual precipitation and annual temperature as the primary probable drivers of this gradient. Ice cover during the Last Glacial Maximum was also identified as an 'important' variable, but the contemporary and historical predictors are strongly collinear. Geographically weighted regression indicated that the relationships between richness and environmental variables vary regionally: the relationship between tree richness and precipitation is stronger in north-central Chile, whereas tree richness and temperature are most strongly associated in south-central Chile. By assigning each species the age of the family to which it belongs and averaging all species in each geographical unit, we also found that species from the oldest families are distributed mainly in mid to high latitudes and species from younger families are distributed mainly at lower latitudes. This pattern is closely associated with annual precipitation. Thus, the ecological component of tree richness follows contemporary climatic gradients of both energy and water, but the aridification of the Atacama Desert was an important driver over evolutionary time. The influence of recent Pleistocene glaciation remains unresolved but it cannot be discounted. © 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.",Climate-richness relationship; Diversity gradient; Pleistocene glaciation; Tropical conservatism hypothesis,aridification; biogeography; evolutionary theory; glaciation; Last Glacial Maximum; latitude; niche partitioning; paleoclimate; phylogenetics; regression analysis; species richness; water availability; Andes; Atacama Desert; Chile; Coastal Cordillera,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888370629,,FALSE,

Characteristic for this genus is a bulbous involute shell with strong radial ribbing and a ventral keel, which appears in post-juvenile ontogenetic stages. The combination of these morphological features is unique among post-Palaeozoic nautiloids. Both species are restricted to the Late Turonian-Middle Coniacian of Central Europe and England. Until now, the type species D. leiotropis was known based only on the holotype specimen. This specimen is re-described with revised occurrence and for the first time photographically illustrated. The only preserved syntype from the type specimens of D. rugatum was re-discovered during this revision and more than thirty other specimens were studied. Representatives of Deltocymatoceras show clear morphological changes during their ontogeny and acquisition of maturity, most notably the appearance of a ventral keel in premature stages and its disappearance at maturity. The hypothesis of a close phylogenetic affinity of Deltocymatoceras to the genus Cymatoceras Hyatt, 1884 is based on similar morphological features such as the suture, ribbing, shell shape and early ontogenetic development. The ventral keel is quite an exceptional feature of morphology in post-Palaeozoic nautiloids. In particular the combination with an involute depressed shell is only shared with representatives of the genus Angulithes Montfort, 1808 (Cretaceous-Palaeogene) and Gryponautilus Mojsisovic, 1902 (Triassic). The combination with a compressed and evolute planispiral shell is more common in Palaeozoic and some post-Palaeozoic nautiloids. The ventral keel is discussed here in relation to its functional aspects (hydrodynamic stability) in combination with the strong radial ribbing (protection of the shell against mechanical damage). The appearance of the genus concurred with the late Turonian shallowing/cooling associated with the ""Hyphantoceras Event"" and the availability of an ecologic niche (i.e., absence of medium-sized, keeled ammonites at that time).

In particular, we were interested in whether the two approaches were congruent and identified the same glacial refugia. Location: South-western European Alps. Methods: For the phylogeographical analysis we included 352 individuals from 28 populations of P. marginata and 172 individuals from 15 populations of P. latifolia and used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). For palaeodistribution modelling, species distribution models (SDMs) were based on extant species occurrences and then projected to climate models (CCSM, MIROC) of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), c. 21 ka. Results: The locations of the modelled LGM refugia were supported by various indices of genetic variation. The refugia of the two species were largely geographically isolated, overlapping only 6-11% of the species' total LGM distribution. This overlap decreased when the position of the glacial ice sheet and the differential elevational and edaphic distributions of the two species were considered. Main conclusions: The combination of phylogeography and palaeodistribution modelling proved useful in locating putative glacial refugia of the two alpine species of Primula.

Further, we investigate mammoth (Mammuthus) and mastodon (Mammut) environmental niche partitioning using stable isotope analysis of bone and dentin collagen (δ13Ccol, δ15Ncol) and structural carbonate in tooth enamel bioapatite (δ13Csc, δ18Osc), and demonstrate that stable isotopes can be used to identify non-locals among museum specimens with no contextual records. New radiocarbon dates suggest that Ontario mastodons lived in tundra-like environments as well as their more common spruce forest habitat. Local Ontario/New York mammoths and mastodons consumed 100% C3-plant diets and drank low-18O waters, consistent with colder-than-modern climates and proximity to glacial meltwater sources. Mammoths and mastodons occupied distinct environmental niches, characterized by different oxygen- and nitrogen-isotope compositions and geographical locations. This suggests that direct competition for resources was not a major factor in their local extinction. We suggest that both mammoths and mastodons obtained water from sources formed primarily from precipitation rather than glacial meltwater. We describe how high δ15N values in mammoths could have been caused by a combination of preferences for dry environments, consumption of low-nutrient forage (particularly stems and stalks), coprophagy, geophagy, and dung fertilization. We argue that low δ15N values in mastodons could have been caused by consumption of trees and shrubs (including nitrogen-fixing taxa) and a preference for recently deglaciated landscapes and/or spruce environments. Finally, we raise the possibility that mastodons contributed to the spruce-pine transition by browsing directly on spruce trees. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Carbon isotope; Diet; Extinction; Great Lakes; Mammoth; Mastodon; Megafauna; Migration; New York; Niche; Nitrogen isotope; Ontario; Oxygen isotope; Pleistocene,Carbon isotopes; Great lakes; Mammoth; Mastodon; Megafauna; Migration; New York; Niche; Nitrogen isotopes; Ontario; Oxygen isotopes; Pleistocene; Forestry; Glacial geology; Lakes; Light extinction; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Nutrition; Oxygen; Plants (botany); Tooth enamel; Isotopes; carbon isotope; extinction; landscape; meltwater; niche partitioning; nitrogen isotope; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; precipitation (climatology); radiocarbon dating; stable isotope; taxonomy; vegetation structure; Carbon; Isotopes; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Plants; Great Lakes [North America],Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881096325,,FALSE,

In this study, variability due to plant species turnover was eliminated by focusing on the arthropods utilizing a single widely distributed plant species, Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae). This enabled us to examine the effects of geography and climate on arthropod species turnover. Location: Neotropics (USA to Argentina). Methods: A statistical approach was used to determine whether arthropod assemblages across the range of P. aculeata differed significantly between biogeographical areas. We determined whether host-specific arthropods have more restricted ranges, contributing to higher species turnover. Finally, generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) was used to correlate significant differences in assemblages between biogeographical provinces with environmental differences and geographical separation. Results: Phytophagous arthropod assemblages differed significantly between biogeographical areas. Most herbivores had a small geographical distribution. We did not detect higher species turnover for host-specific species. The GDM model explained 21.8% of the variance in species assemblages. Of the variables examined, climate and geographical distance were both better predictors of variation in phytophagous arthropod assemblages on P. aculeata than biogeographical areas, with climate the better predictor of the two. Main conclusions: Observed patterns in turnover of the phytophagous insect fauna of P. aculeata are consistent with expected broad-scale responses to historical processes and climatic variation. Climate and geography explain similar proportions of compositional dissimilarity, and most species, regardless of host-specificity, have restricted geographical ranges. The statistically significant differences observed between arthropod assemblages in different biogeographical provinces are likely to be caused by a combination of niche-based processes and to some extent dispersal limitation. Although variability due to host plant has been eliminated in the current study, there remains no simple explanation for broad-scale patterns in the distribution of phytophagous arthropods. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Beta diversity; Biological control; Generalized dissimilarity modelling; Insect-plant interaction; Invasive plant; Leguminosae; Neotropics; Parkinsonia aculeata,arthropod; biological control; climate variation; dicotyledon; geographical distribution; host plant; host specificity; invasive species; legume; Neotropic Ecozone; paleobiogeography; plant-insect interaction; species diversity; turnover; Argentina; United States; Arthropoda; Caesalpinioideae; Fabaceae; Hexapoda; Parkinsonia aculeata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881615386,,FALSE,?

This study examines the phylogenetic relationships among Pomacanthus species, tests whether the degree of sympatry among sister taxa correlates with their age, and explores potential modes of diversification. Location: Pan-tropical coral reef systems. Methods: Three gene regions (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and nuclear S7) from all 13 Pomacanthus species were used in conjunction with fossil calibration to reconstruct a chronogram. IUCN maps were used to evaluate geographical range overlap. Various age-range correlation (ARC) analyses were used to test for a correlation between range overlap and node age. Range-size symmetry and node age were also examined. Results: Biogeographical splits within the phylogeny corroborated key biogeographical events well, suggesting a potential role for allopatric speciation in the evolutionary history of the genus. ARC analyses suggested that speciation leading to sympatry is widespread in Pomacanthus, with 80% of sister species showing complete or substantial (> 85%) range overlap. No significant relationship between degree of sympatry and node age was recovered, which demonstrates that, for this group, exceptional sympatry is not necessarily a result of relatively old lineages. Range-size symmetry analysis was consistent with models of peripatric speciation within a finite area. Main conclusions: We present evidence consistent with allopatric speciation, while our ARC results are consistent with simulations of sympatric speciation, with the possibility of peripheral budding having led to the richness of sympatric species in the West Indian Ocean.

We used these distributions to test the hypothesis that when projected onto past, alternative climate surfaces, species distribution models (SDMs) created using only climate variables are concordant with the empirical data of fossil Microtus species occurrences. Location: Specimens from 11 fossil localities in California, Oregon and Nevada were identified and evaluated. Methods: Geometric morphometrics and discriminant analyses were used to identify fossil Microtus specimens. Using a maximum-entropy modelling approach, the best model for all five species was selected using the Akaike information criterion. Nineteen bioclimate variables were used to create SDMs for the five Microtus species using both Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) models. Results: We confidently identified 144 Microtus fossils, including the first fossil specimens of Microtus oregoni and Microtus townsendii. SDMs reconstructed approximately half the extralimital fossil occurrences (i.e. those found outside the present-day range). Those species with extralimital occurrences not reconstructed have niche models primarily influenced by precipitation variables. The two species whose extralimitals were well predicted occupy indistinguishable climatic niches. Main conclusions: The ranges of Pacific coast Microtus species have undergone substantial regional contractions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 ka). Inconsistencies between LGM SDMs and Quaternary fossil ranges indicate potential problems with LGM precipitation reconstructions, although interspecific interactions are also likely to contribute to these differences. Overall, the study highlights the need for further, detailed, species-level palaeodistributions to put recent observations in a broader temporal context and examine the effectiveness of SDMs coupled with climate models for predicting range dynamics under scenarios of climate change. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Arvicolinae; Ecological niche; MaxEnt; Microtus; Palaeontology; Quaternary; Range; Rodent; Species distribution model; Western USA,Akaike information criterion; bioclimatology; climate effect; climate modeling; climate variation; fossil record; hypothesis testing; Last Glacial Maximum; maximum entropy analysis; morphometry; paleontology; population distribution; reconstruction; rodent; California; Nevada; Oregon; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States; Arvicolinae; Microtus; Microtus oregoni; Microtus townsendii; Rodentia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880506394,,TRUE,

The evolution of reptile herbivory and its relationship to mammalian diversification is poorly understoodwith respect to climate and the roles of predation pressure and competition for food resources. Here, we describe a giant fossil acrodontan lizard recovered with a diverse mammal assemblage from the late middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of Myanmar, which provides a historical test of factors controlling body size in herbivorous squamates.We infer a predominately herbivorous feeding ecology for the new acrodontan based on dental anatomy, phylogenetic relationships and body size. Ranking body masses for Pondaung Formation vertebrates indicates that the lizard occupied a size niche among the larger herbivores and was larger than most carnivorous mammals. Paleotemperature estimates of Pondaung Formation environments based on the body size of the new lizard are approximately 2-5°C higher than modern. These results indicate that competitive exclusion and predation by mammals did not restrict body size evolution in these herbivorous squamates, and elevated temperatures relative to modern climates during the Paleogene greenhouse may have resulted in the evolution of gigantism through elevated poikilothermic metabolic rates and in response to increases in floral productivity. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We provide one of the first comparative evaluations of the ability of a purely spatial SDM, a purely non-spatial SDM and a SDM that combines spatial and environmental information to project species distributions across eight millennia of climate change. Location: Eastern North America. Methods: To distinguish between the importance of climatic versus spatial explanatory variables we fit three Bayesian SDMs to modern occurrence data for Fagus and Tsuga, two tree genera whose distributions can be reliably inferred from fossil pollen: a spatially varying intercept model, a non-spatial model with climatic variables and a spatially varying intercept plus climate model. Using palaeoclimate data with a high temporal resolution, we hindcasted the SDMs in 1000-year time steps for 8000 years, and compared model projections with palynological data for the same periods. Results: For both genera, spatial SDMs provided better fits to the calibration data, more accurate predictions of a hold-out validation dataset of modern trees and higher variance in current predictions and hindcasted projections than non-spatial SDMs. Performance of non-spatial and spatial SDMs according to the area under the receiver operating curve varied by genus. For both genera, false negative rates between non-spatial and spatial models were similar, but spatial models had lower false positive rates than non-spatial models.

In general, species can respond to such changes by behavioral accommodation, distributional shifts, ecophenotypic modifications (nongenetic), evolution (genetic) or ultimately face local extinction. How those responses manifested in the past is essential for properly predicting future ones especially as the current warm phase is further intensified by rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Here, we use ancient DNA (aDNA) and morphological features in combination with ecological niche modeling (ENM) to investigate genetic and nongenetic responses of Central European Palearctic shrews to past climatic change. We show that a giant form of shrew, previously described as an extinct Pleistocene Sorex species, represents a large ecomorph of the common shrew (Sorex araneus), which was replaced by populations from a different gene-pool and with different morphology after the Pleistocene Holocene transition. We also report the presence of the cold-adapted tundra shrew (S. tundrensis) in Central Europe. This species is currently restricted to Siberia and was hitherto unknown as an element of the Pleistocene fauna of Europe. Finally, we show that there is no clear correlation between climatic oscillations within the last 50 000 years and body size in shrews and conclude that a special nonanalogous situation with regard to biodiversity and food supply in the Late Glacial may have caused the observed large body size. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Ancient DNA; Body size change; Ecological niche modeling; Late quaternary climate change; Palearctic shrews,"DNA; biodiversity; biostratigraphy; body size; carbon dioxide; climate oscillation; climate variation; DNA; ecological modeling; environmental change; Last Glacial; mammal; niche; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; phenotype; population genetics; Quaternary; animal; Arctic; article; climate change; cluster analysis; genetics; physiology; shrew; theoretical model; Animals; Arctic Regions; Climate Change; Cluster Analysis; DNA; Models, Theoretical; Shrews; Sorex; Sorex araneus; Sorex tundrensis; Soricidae",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877069517,,TRUE,

Steppe bison, horse, and woolly mammoth became extinct, moose and humans invaded, while muskox and caribou persisted. The ice age megafauna was more diverse in species and possibly contained 6× more individual animals than live in the region today. Megafaunal biomass during the last ice age may have been 30× greater than present. Horse was the dominant species in terms of number of individuals. Lions, short-faced bears, wolves, and possibly grizzly bears comprised the predator/scavenger guild. The youngest mammoth so far discovered lived ca13,800 years ago, while horses and bison persisted on the North Slope until at least 12,500 years ago during the Younger Dryas cold interval. The first people arrived on the North Slope ca13,500 years ago. Bone-isotope measurements and foot-loading characteristics suggest megafaunal niches were segregated along a moisture gradient, with the surviving species (muskox and caribou) utilizing the warmer and moister portions of the vegetation mosaic. As the ice age ended, the moisture gradient shifted and eliminated habitats utilized by the dryland, grazing species (bison, horse, mammoth). The proximate cause for this change was regional paludification, the spread of organic soil horizons and peat. End-Pleistocene extinctions in arctic Alaska represent local, not global extinctions since the megafaunal species lost there persisted to later times elsewhere. Hunting seems unlikely as the cause of these extinctions, but it cannot be ruled out as the final blow to megafaunal populations that were already functionally extinct by the time humans arrived in the region. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Alaska; Arctic; Bones; Climate change; Extinction; Horse; Ice age; Megafauna; Peat; Pleistocene; Steppe bison; Woolly mammoth,Alaska; Arctic; Horse; Ice age; Megafauna; Pleistocene; Steppe bison; Woolly mammoths; Animals; Bone; Climate change; Glacial geology; Isotopes; Light extinction; Moisture; Peat; Soils; Loading; biological invasion; biomass; bone; climate variation; mammal; mass extinction; moisture content; paleoclimate; paleontology; paludification; peat; Pleistocene; soil horizon; steppe; survival; Alaska; Arctic; United States; Animalia; Bison; Bison priscus; Canidae; Equidae; Mammalia; Mammuthus primigenius; Ovibos moschatus moschatus; Rangifer tarandus; Ursus arctos,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877134537,,FALSE,

Various hypotheses have been advanced to account for these facts, of which niche partitioning is among the most frequently invoked. However, despite its wide acceptance, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. This study uses the fossil assemblage from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta as a model to investigate whether niche partitioning facilitated herbivorous dinosaur coexistence on Laramidia. Specifically, the question of feeding height stratification is examined in light of the role it plays in facilitating modern ungulate coexistence.Results: Most herbivorous dinosaur species from the Dinosaur Park Formation were restricted to feeding no higher than approximately 1 m above the ground. There is minimal evidence for feeding height partitioning at this level, with ceratopsids capable of feeding slightly higher than ankylosaurs, but the ecological significance of this is ambiguous. Hadrosaurids were uniquely capable of feeding up to 2 m quadrupedally, or up to 5 m bipedally. There is no evidence for either feeding height stratification within any of these clades, or for change in these ecological relationships through the approximately 1.5 Ma record of the Dinosaur Park Formation.Conclusions: Although we cannot reject the possibility, we find no good evidence that feeding height stratification, as revealed by reconstructed maximum feeding heights, played an important role in facilitating niche partitioning among the herbivorous dinosaurs of Laramidia. Most browsing pressure was concentrated in the herb layer, although hadrosaurids were capable of reaching shrubs and low-growing trees that were out of reach from ceratopsids, ankylosaurs, and other small herbivores, effectively dividing the herbivores in terms of relative abundance. Sympatric hadrosaurids may have avoided competing with one another by feeding differentially using bipedal and quadrupedal postures. These ecological relationships evidently proved to be evolutionarily stable because they characterize the herbivore assemblage of the Dinosaur Park Formation through time. If niche partitioning served to facilitate the rich diversity of these animals, it may have been achieved by other means in addition to feeding height stratification. Consideration of other feeding height proxies, including dental microwear and skull morphology, may help to alleviate problems of underdetermination identified here. © 2013 Mallon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Ankylosauria; Ceratopsidae; Dinosaur Park Formation; Evolutionary palaeoecology; Feeding height stratification; Hadrosauridae; Niche partitioning,abundance; biomass; Campanian; coexistence; Cretaceous; dinosaur; feeding behavior; fossil assemblage; herbivore; niche partitioning; paleoecology; shrub; species diversity; tree; ungulate; Alberta; Canada; Dinosaur Provincial Park; Animalia; Ankylosauria; Ceratopsidae; Dinosauria; Hadrosauridae; Ungulata; animal; Canada; classification; dinosaur; feeding behavior; fossil; herbivory; paleontology; physiology; article; dinosaur; herbivory; physiology; Animals; Canada; Dinosaurs; Feeding Behavior; Fossils; Herbivory; Paleontology; Animals; Canada; Dinosaurs; Feeding Behavior; Fossils; Herbivory; Paleontology,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875690327,,FALSE,

We focused on palaeodistribution models of three 'focal' tree species that occur in wet and seasonally dry Central American forests, where recent phylogeographic data suggest Pleistocene differentiation coincident with previously proposed refugia. We added predictions from six wet-forest and six seasonally dry-forest obligate plant species to gauge whether Pleistocene range shifts were specific to habitat type. Correlation analyses were performed between projected LGM and present distributions, LGM distributions and previously proposed refugia. We also asked whether modelled palaeodistributions were smaller than their current extents. Results According to our models, the ranges of the study species were not reduced during the LGM, and did not correlate with refugial models, regardless of habitat type. Relative range sizes between present and LGM distributions did not indicate significant range changes since the LGM. However, relative range sizes differed overall between the two palaeoclimate models. Main conclusions Many of the modelled palaeodistributions of study species were not restricted to refugia during the LGM, regardless of forest type. While constrained from higher elevations, most species found suitable habitat at coastal margins and on newly exposed land due to lowered sea levels during the LGM. These results offer no corroboration for Pleistocene climate change as a driver of genetic differentiation in the 'focal' species. We offer alternative explanations for genetic differentiation found in plant species in this area. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Central America; Ecological niche modelling; Last Glacial Maximum; Neotropical tree diversity; Palaeodistribution modelling; Phylogeography; Pleistocene refuge theory,genetic differentiation; habitat type; niche partitioning; paleobotany; paleoclimate; phylogeography; Pleistocene; range size; refuge; taxonomy; Central America,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875069496,,TRUE,

Originally described as unrelated species, they have recently been interpreted as a clade; their flexible tentacles, camera-type eyes, lateral fins, internal gills, axial cavity, and funnel point to a relationship with the cephalopods. However, aspects of this reinterpretation, including the relevance of the group to cephalopod evolution, have been called into question. Here, I examine new and existing nectocaridid material, including a large new form that may represent a sexual dimorph of Nectocaris pteryx. Differences between existing taxa largely represent taphonomic variation between sites and specimens-which provides further constraint on the organisms' anatomy. I revise the morphology of the tentacles and fins, and describe mouthparts and phosphatized gills for the first time. A mathematical analysis supports the presence of the earliest known camera-type eyes, and fluid mechanical considerations suggest that the funnel is optimized for efficient jet propulsion in a low Reynolds number flow regime. Nectocaridids closely resemble coleoid cephalopods, but a position deeper within Cephalopoda raises fewer stratigraphic challenges. Whether its coleoid-like construction reflects common ancestry or profound convergence, the Nectocaris body plan adds substantially to Cambrian disparity, demonstrating the rapid colonization of nektobenthic niches after the Cambrian explosion. © 2013 The Paleontological Society.

A multi-temporal model calibration approach has been suggested as an alternative, and we evaluate this using 13,000 years of data. Location Europe. Methods We used fossil-based records of presence for Picea abies, Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica and six climatic variables for the period 13,000 to 1000yr bp. To measure the contribution of each 1000-year time step to the total niche of each species (the niche measured by pooling all the data), we employed a principal components analysis (PCA) calibrated with data over the entire range of possible climates. Then we projected both the total niche and the partial niches from single time frames into the PCA space, and tested if the partial niches were more similar to the total niche than random. Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we calibrated SDMs for each time frame and for the pooled database. We projected each model to current climate and evaluated the results against current pollen data. We also projected all models into the future. Results Niche similarity between the partial and the total-SDMs was almost always statistically significant and increased through time. SDMs calibrated from single time frames gave different results when projected to current climate, providing evidence of a change in the species realized niches through time. Moreover, they predicted limited climate suitability when compared with the total-SDMs. The same results were obtained when projected to future climates. Main conclusions The realized climatic niche of species differed for current and future climates when SDMs were calibrated considering different past climates.

We develop reserve-selection strategies for the IAE and check them against rankings based on modern data. Location Northern and eastern North America. Methods Three reserve-selection strategies are developed. (1) Abiotic: the IAE uses no information about species-climate relationships, instead maximizing the climatic and geographic dispersion of reserves. (2) Species distribution models (SDMs): the IAE uses boosted-regression trees calibrated against pollen data and CCSM3 palaeoclimatic simulations from 21 to 15 ka bp to predict modern taxon distributions, then uses these as input to the Zonation reserve-ranking program. (3) Rank-and-regress: regression models are used to identify climatic predictors of zonation rankings. All strategies are assessed against a Zonation ranking based on modern pollen distributions. Analysis units are ecoregions and grid cells. Results The abiotic strategy has a negative or no correlation between predicted and actual rankings. The SDM-based strategy fares better, with a significantly positive area-corrected correlation (r= 0.474, P < 0.001) between predicted and actual rankings. Predictive ability drops when grid cells are the analysis unit (r= 0.217, P = 0.058). Predictive ability for the rank-and-regress strategy is similar to the SDM results. Main conclusions For the IAE, SDMs improve the predictive ability of reserve-selection strategies. However, predictive ability is limited overall, probably due to shifted realized niches during past no-analogue climates, new species interactions as species responded individually to climate change, and other environmental changes not included in the model. Twenty-first-century conservation planning also faces these challenges, and is further complicated by other anthropogenic impacts. The IAE's limited success does not preclude the use of climate scenarios and niche-based SDMs when developing adaptation strategies, but suggests that such tools offer at best only a rough guide to identifying possible areas of future conservation value. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Niche models; No-analogue climates; Palaeoecology; Pollen; Reserve selection; Species distribution models; Zonation,biodiversity; climate variation; dispersion; ecoregion; environmental change; global warming; last deglaciation; new species; niche; paleoclimate; paleoecology; Pleistocene; pollen; regression analysis; taxonomy; testing method; North America,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873955627,,TRUE,?

Here, we test this hypothesis by combining information on current diversity gradients among lineages, lineage initiation dates, and palaeoclimatic reconstructions. Location: World-wide. Methods: We test the niche conservatism hypothesis by comparing slopes of latitudinal diversity gradients among terrestrial and aquatic lineages derived from 343 studies from around the world. The prediction is that clades originating during warm periods should be very species rich in tropical regions, exhibiting a steeper richness gradient from lower to higher latitudes than clades originating during cold periods, which are expected to exhibit shallower latitudinal species richness gradients. Results: Latitudinal gradients for clades that originated in warm climates are steeper and with a strong tropical affinity, whereas organisms originating in colder periods exhibit a shallower diversity gradient or no tropical affinity. Conclusions: For a broad variety of plants and animals of both marine and terrestrial realms our results are consistent with the idea that higher diversities have arisen among tropical clades because the earth has been predominantly tropical throughout most of its history. Most clades radiated in tropical climates, with subsequent climate changes causing a retraction in distributions.

Recent studies of North American and Asian pikas have uncovered phylogeographical partitioning among separate mountain ranges and drainages, driven by Quaternary climate fluctuations. We tested the prediction that collared pikas (O. collaris) exhibit lower genetic diversity and less structure than other species of pika due to lower long-term habitat stability. Location: Eastern Beringia (Alaska and north-western Canada). Methods: We examined phylogeographical variation in the collared pika (O. collaris) throughout much of its known range using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Population divergence and genetic diversity were compared within and between mountain ranges. Genetic diversity was contrasted with current and Pleistocene habitat fragmentation inferred from ecological niche models. Results: Low but significant differentiation was evident between most populations of O. collaris, with little haplotype sharing among populations and a single phylogeographical break separating a genetically distinct haplogroup in the south-eastern part of its range. Variation was mostly structured within populations (as opposed to between populations or mountain ranges). When within-species nucleotide diversity in O. collaris, O. princeps and O. curzoniae was compared, genetic diversity was found to decline with increasing latitude. Main conclusions: Populations of O. collaris are less geographically structured and exhibit less variability than populations of either O. princeps or O. curzoniae. This pattern is better explained by the amount of available Pleistocene habitat predicted for each species than by current predicted habitat or population discontinuity.

We sought to determine whether Hawaiian Artemisia (Compositae-Anthemideae), which includes lowland and subalpine species, represents such an example, by investigating the origin and relationships of the Hawaiian taxa. Location: Hawaiian Islands and continental settings world-wide (except Antarctica and Australia). Methods: Molecular phylogenetic analyses of Hawaiian Artemisia in the context of world-wide diversity were conducted using nuclear and chloroplast DNA spacers. The timing of divergence events associated with inferred dispersals was estimated with calibration from fossil pollen records. Historical biogeographical analyses based on molecular trees and ecological modelling of the distributions of extant taxa were used to aid the interpretation of geographical and habitat shifts associated with diversification and long-distance dispersal. Results: Our findings indicate that the Hawaiian endemic species (A. australis, A. kauaiensis and A. mauiensis) constitute a clade sister to Southeast Asian A. chinensis, which, like the Hawaiian endemics, has ribbed fruit walls and, unlike other members of Artemisia except A. kauaiensis, has a distinct pappus, which is often associated with dispersal ability in Compositae. The clade encompassing A. chinensis and Hawaiian Artemisia was resolved to be most likely of Asian origin. The natural occurrence of A. chinensis in littoral habitats of Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Ryukyu and Bonin islands, and of A. australis in similar settings in the Hawaiian Islands, is likely to reflect the ancestral ecology of the Hawaiian clade, with subsequent colonization of inland, higher-elevation habitats, including subalpine shrubland, where A. mauiensis is endemic. Main conclusions: An ecological shift in Hawaiian Artemisia from tropical coastal habitats to drier and colder subalpine slopes is consistent with evidence from recent studies for repeated colonization of the Arctic by diverse lineages of Artemisia. Artemisia appears to be prone to such anticlimatic ecological shifts, which may explain this exceptional example of an ancestrally lowland tropical lineage in the Hawaiian high-montane flora. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Artemisia; Asteraceae; Convergent evolution; Evolutionary tendencies; Habitat shifts; Hawaii; Island biogeography; Long-distance dispersal; Niche conservatism; Tropical ecology,ancestry; cladistics; colonization; convergent evolution; dicotyledon; dispersal; divergence; endemic species; fossil record; habitat type; island biogeography; littoral environment; lowland environment; molecular analysis; niche; palynology; phylogeny; phylogeography; subalpine environment; tropical environment; Bonin Islands; Hawaii [United States]; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Okinawa Island; Okinawa Islands; Ryukyu Islands; Taiwan; Tokyo [Kanto]; United States; Anthemideae; Artemisia; Artemisia australis; Artemisia kauaiensis; Artemisia mauiensis; Asteraceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873724457,,FALSE,

However, there are many sources of uncertainty in SDM that may restrict the ability of models to hindcast palaeo-distributions and provide a basis for hypothesis testing in molecular phylogenetics and phylogeographical studies. Location: Seasonally dry forests (SDFs) in South America. Methods: We addressed the problem of using palaeodistribution modelling for SDFs based on the projection of their current distribution into past environments (21 ka) using 11 methods for SDMs and five coupled atmosphere-ocean global circulation models (AOGCMs) for 16 species. Results: We observed considerable uncertainty in the hindcasts, with the most important effects for AOGCM (median 12.2%), species (median 15.6%) and their interaction (median 13.6%). The effects of AOGCMs were stronger in the Amazon region, whereas the species effect occurred primarily in the dry areas of central Brazil. The log-linear model detected significant effects of the three sources of variation and their interaction on the classification of each map in supporting alternative hypotheses. An expansion scenario combining the Pleistocene arc and Amazonian expansion, and Pennington's Amazonian expansion alone, were the most frequently supported palaeodistribution scenarios. Main conclusions: As a basis for evaluating a given hypothesis, hindcast distributions must be used in direct association with other evidence, such as molecular variation and the fossil record. We propose an alternative framework concerning hypothesis testing that couples SDM and phylogeographical work, in which palaeoclimatic distributions and other sources of information, such as the pollen fossil record and coalescence modelling, must be weighted equally. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Cerrado biome; Dry forests; Palaeodistribution models; Pleistocene arc; Pleistocene refugia; Quaternary climatic change; South America; Species distribution modelling,biome; cerrado; climate variation; dry forest; ecological modeling; fossil record; general circulation model; geographical distribution; hypothesis testing; molecular analysis; paleoclimate; phylogeny; phylogeography; phytogeography; Pleistocene; refugium; seasonality; vegetation history; South America,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872611344,,TRUE,*

Location: North Atlantic coastlines. Methods: We develop a novel application of species distribution models for intertidal taxa by using both oceanographic and terrestrial environmental variables recently made available at biologically relevant pixel resolutions. We use these model-based distribution estimates to test alternative hypotheses of late Pleistocene history across six amphi-Atlantic taxa whose hypothesized Pleistocene distributions are constructed from previous population genetic inferences. Results: Species distribution models correctly estimate all six current amphi-Atlantic distributions on both sides of the Atlantic. Models hindcasted to the Last Glacial Maximum estimate trans-Atlantic distributional persistence in three of six taxa, and conversely indicate no suitable habitat on the North American coastline in the other three taxa. These results are consistent with the histories inferred from population genetic data for five of six of the taxa, the exception being Nucella lapillus, whose hindcasted trans-Atlantic persistence at the Last Glacial Maximum contrasts with the mitochondrial DNA-based estimates of post-glacial expansion from Europe to North America. Main conclusions: Marine and terrestrial distribution models are broadly concordant with known contemporary distributions and fail to reject five of six historical distributional hypotheses based on population genetic inferences. This demonstrated utility suggests that this technique could be expanded to examine how Pleistocene and contemporary climate change might play a role in intertidal species distributions across the entire community.

Radiocarbon-dated to ∼39.6 ka cal BP, the time of Heinrich Stadial (HS) 4, this site enables us to reconstruct the environmental conditions then prevalent in the NE of the Iberian Peninsula. The concentration in a single locus of finds generated by different agents relates to a flash-flood event, the rapidity of which, combined with the absence of archaeological, ecological or paleontological incongruities in the composition of the assemblage, warrants an assumption of broad contemporaneity for its contents. The ecofactual evidence (fauna, pollen, charcoal, phytoliths) indicates a steppe-dominated environment for the coastal areas between the Pyrenees and the Ebro delta; the dominant elements are cold- and dry-adapted species but a Mediterranean component is present, implying a less rigorous climate than farther north in Europe. The artifacts are clearly Upper Paleolithic, and assignment to the modern human-associated Aurignacian technocomplex is supported by the radiocarbon dates and the typology of a bilaterally retouched blade. This evidence is consistent with the notion that anatomical modernity spread across Europe over open landscape niches. Available pollen data from deep sea cores indicate that, during some of the interstadials of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, a significant vegetation gradient existed at 40°N, broadly coincident with the "" Ebro frontier:"" temperate and warm temperate trees expanded significantly to the south, while steppe-tundra landscapes remained dominant to the north, a contrast best seen during Greenland Interstadial (GI) 8. Such an environmental boundary must have implied a durable barrier to diffusion and migration during interstadials. Under the cold and arid conditions of HS4, the site of Canyars shows that the Eurasian steppe-tundra extended as far south as the Llobregat delta; however, the environmental reconstructions available for the lower Ebro valley and adjacent mountains of the Iberian Range farther south suggest that they formed at this time a belt of semi-desert or steppe-desert landscapes, thus maintaining the boundary effect despite the climatic reversal. The persistence of such a boundary through HS4 and the interstadials that bracket it must have played a role in the delayed arrival of the Aurignacian (and modern humans) to southern and western Iberia, which continued to be settled by Middle Paleolithic Neanderthals well beyond 40 ka cal BP. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Aurignacian; Heinrich Stadial 4; Iberian Peninsula; Neanderthals; Paleoenvironment; Upper Pleistocene,Aurignacian; Heinrich Stadial 4; Iberian Peninsula; Neanderthals; Paleo-environment; Pleistocene; Charcoal; Floods; Humanities computing; Isotopes; Landforms; archaeology; artifact; carnivore; den; felid; flash flood; fluvial deposit; fossil record; Heinrich event; migration; Neanderthal; paleoenvironment; paleontology; Pleistocene; radiocarbon dating; steppe; tundra; typology; vegetation dynamics; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Ebro Delta; Gava; Iberian Peninsula; Pyrenees; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Mammalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870316488,,FALSE,

It is to the Greeks that we owe the first systematic agricultural landscaping of the Italian South. The region, known as Lucania even before the Romans, later took the name of Basilicata, except for a short period, from 1932 to 1947, when it officially resumed its ancient name.

Its harsh and craggy morphology has always influenced the character of Lucanian agriculture, as well as that of its society and economy. 35 % of the region’s area is covered with woods. The utilized agricultural surface extends over little more than half of the total surface, and consists for 27.5 % of pastures and 72 % of farmland. Although the area with the best potential morphological and bioclimatic conditions for farming is that of Metaponto, it only became available for agriculture after major reclaiming works were completed in the first half of the twentieth century. Hence, Lucanian agricultural landscapes having a “historical character” are concentrated in the hills, where ever since the time of Magna Graecia the crops that epitomize “Mediterraneity” appeared; notably the olive tree (the steno-Mediterranean species par excellence) and the sub-Mediterranean grapevine. The Metaponto area is presently one of the most important fruit and vegetable districts in all of Italy. Although here citrus growing mainly began to spread in the last century, a few kilometers from the plain, on the gentle clayish slopes between Tursi and Montalbano Jonico, the “Staccia” orange has been grown since ancient times, foreshadowing what was to transpire many years later down in the reclaimed lands in the plain. A poorer agriculture, instead, has been traditionally practiced in the mountains. Wheat, as well as typical and niche vegetables, have always been the typical crops of the marginal agriculture of the plateaus and small valleys of the many Lucanian massifs. The cultivation of wheat deserves separate consideration. It has always been grown in Lucania. By 1975 it already accounted for over 30 % of the Useful Agricultural Surface (UAS), and has been expanding constantly over the last few decades. The cost of this expansion has mainly been paid by the meso-xerophilous woods of hill and low mountain slopes, whose best preserved testimony is presently found in the pastureland of the Matera side of the Puglian Avampaese. The northeast area of Basilicata, instead, ever since the abolition of the Dogana della Mena delle Pecore has become the best example of the expansion of non-irrigated farmland. As part of this process, the tillage of the soil of Monteserico at Genzano, with its 17,000 ha of woods, bush and pastures (some of the best in the Dogana di Foggia), on the one hand, and the deforestation of the nearby Bosco della Badia near Banzi, regarded at the time as one of the most extensive Lucanian forests, were among the most emblematic episodes in the transformation of the Lucanian agrarian landscape in the second half of the nineteenth century. Returning to deforestation, this is undoubtedly a phenomenon that affected the whole Western world in a rather recent past, although in different ways and at different times. At any rate, the expansion of woods registered in Italy in the last century also regarded Lucania. Today the region has dense and extensive woods that are being exploited in multiple ways. The historical relevance of the Vulture chestnut groves and their importance for the mountain populations is stressed in the entry devoted to them in the present catalogue. The thick woods of this area gave shelter to brigands who infested the whole region in the second half of the nineteenth century, a phenomenon depending on the extreme indigence of the local population. As in the rest of southern Italy, there was very high emigration here in the early 1900s. It is worth mentioning that the spread of the Turkish oak (Quercus cerris) mainly depended on the use of its especially hard and durable wood to make sleepers for Italy’s “historical” railways. Trees of this species form some of the most beautiful groves in the stretch of the Apennines extending from the Sella di Conza to the Passo dello Scalone, such as the cerreta of Monte Croccia near Accettura, the Cupolicchio Woods at Tricarico, etc. The areas we have selected do not bear witness to every aspect of the Lucanian district, but reflect an attempt to highlight an added value found in some significant rural districts; notably, the extraordinary connection between history, traditions, and landscape in districts where cultivations have become the distinctive element of the landscape. Here farming permeates local culture and phenological cycles are synchronous with the life rhythms of local people. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Chestnut Tree; Eighth Century; Historical Character; Olive Orchard; Olive Tree,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126517775,,FALSE,

Fully modern and technologically sophisticated Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens communities re-engineered their ecological niche in keeping with these changes by mapping on to newly productive hunting localities, gathering grounds, and raw-material sources and situating their wintering/home base residential sites in relation to the others. Acorns, nuts, annual seeds, and other foods accessed within such logistic networks were at first gathered wild, but over millennia came to be harvested, tended, and finally domesticated in great quantity. Agriculture, population, and infrastructural additions to natural landscapes expanded in scope. Over a long period, originally familistic lineage heads and elders claimed an ever-increasing authority and personal share of the collective wealth generated by the community. Archeological evidence and written histories, appearing earliest in Central China, document the rise of elite family dynasties that garnered enormous wealth and luxury through their control of agriculture, industry, and trade, while peasant laborers profited far less. Military force applied to outsiders on their borders, and at times to their own people, became an important instrument of this ruling class. Central Riverine China led in all these developments, and over time neighboring peoples in Northeast China, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East engineered their own civic and productive infrastructures according to the same dynamics, resulting in a pervasive spread of anthropogenic landscapes throughout East Asia.

The region is located at the geographical meeting of Eurasia, Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean, and at the boundary between high- to mid-latitude and tropical-subtropical climate systems. The eastern Mediterranean Sea moderates the climate, and in the hinterland away from its influence the region rapidly changes from semiarid landscape to arid desert, resulting in the most variable and extreme climatic conditions with annual precipitation ranging from >. 800 to ~50. mm. The geographical duality of desert existing adjacent to Mediterranean-type climate region played, and still plays, a major role on the water availability in the Middle East and North Africa.Information on paleowater availability is possible through reconstruction of the paleoclimate and environmental conditions based on the application of a number of proxies from the marine and the terrestrial realms. These studies clearly show that two mechanisms that represent fundamentally different climatic driving forces have led to positive freshwater balance in the region: (1) Monsoon-driven processes leading to increased rainfall over the Sahara, which are associated with northward penetration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the Arabian and African continents. This resulted in increased Nile River discharge and discharge of rivers that emerged from the central Sahara into the eastern Mediterranean Sea. (2) Enhanced westerly wind activity that resulted in increased regional rainfall from Atlantic-Mediterranean sources over the entire Mediterranean Basin. This westerly system penetrated further south into the northeast corner of the Sahara Desert during extreme wet periods (the Negev Desert, Israel, and probably Jordan). During intensification of these two systems, the entire Middle East and North Africa were graced with abundant water, as is evident from the fact that cave speleothems were deposited in present-day arid environments and from the existence of large paleolakes. The peak of these extreme wet periods mainly coincided with peak interglacials, that is, with astronomically driven maximum summer insolation at 65°. N latitude and maxima in radiation at the 19-23. ka cycles of orbital precession. The exact duration of the wet intervals is largely based on accurate dating of the timing of speleothem growth and their stable isotopic composition, as well as on the timing of sapropel deposition in the Eastern Mediterranean.The times that can be firmly established for contemporaneous extreme wet conditions in Southern Arabia, North Africa, and the Middle East are also the times indicated as the most favorable 'climatic windows' for the dispersal of hominids and animals out of the African continent. These intervals are dated at: 250-239, 210-193, 138-120, 108-98, 87-84. ka BP, and early Holocene from 10 to 6.5. ka BP. The wetter conditions could provide potable water sites across presently arid land surface barriers, such as the desert regions in Libya, Egypt, southern Jordan, and Israel. The 'wet' periods show some variation in duration on a regional scale and between them, severe dry conditions prevailed in the desert regions.During glacial periods, extremely dry conditions prevailed throughout the Sahara and Arabian deserts, the desert adjacent to the Middle East. However, in the Eastern Mediterranean coastal region (the Levant) and the Jordan Valley, water was available, as is evident from the high stands of the Jordan Valley lakes, and the deposition of speleothems in the Eastern Mediterranean including the Jordan Valley region. Humans and animals could thus enjoy variable ecological niches for living, including caves, rock shelters, and nearby lake shores. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity provides a framework in which to test these alternatives. Our aim is to test whether the structure of marine phytoplankton (diatoms, dinoflagellates and coccolithophores) assemblages across the Atlantic agrees with neutral theory predictions. We asked: (1) whether intersite variance in phytoplankton diversity is explained predominantly by dispersal limitation or by environmental conditions; and (2) whether species abundance distributions are consistent with those expected by the neutral model. Location: Meridional transect of the Atlantic (50° N-50° S). Methods: We estimated the relative contributions of environmental factors and geographic distance to phytoplankton composition using similarity matrices, Mantel tests and variation partitioning of the species composition based upon canonical ordination methods. We compared the species abundance distribution of phytoplankton with the neutral model using Etienne's maximum-likelihood inference method. Results: Phytoplankton communities are slightly more determined by niche segregation (24%), than by dispersal limitation and ecological drift (17%). In 60% of communities, the assumption of neutrality in species' abundance distributions could not be rejected. In tropical zones, where oceanic gyres enclose large stable water masses, most communities showed low species immigration rates; in contrast, we infer that communities in temperate areas, out of oligotrophic gyres, have higher rates of species immigration. Conclusions: Phytoplankton community structure is consistent with partial niche assembly and partial dispersal and drift assembly (neutral processes). The role of dispersal limitation is almost as important as habitat filtering, a fact that has been largely overlooked in previous studies. Furthermore, the polewards increase in immigration rates of species that we have discovered is probably caused by water mixing conditions and productivity. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Atlantic Ocean; Beta diversity; Diatom; Dispersal; Neutral theory; Plankton,biodiversity; community structure; diatom; dinoflagellate; dispersal; phytoplankton; spatial distribution; Atlantic Ocean; Bacillariophyta; Dinophyceae; Haptophyceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876306462,,FALSE,?

Location: Southern Patagonia: Argentina and Chile. Methods: Chloroplast intergenic spacers trnS-trnG and rpoB-trnC were sequenced for 264 individuals from 33 localities spanning the entire distribution of A. desideratum. Phylogenetic (statistical parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) and population genetic analyses (spatial analyses of molecular variance, mismatch distributions, neutrality tests and Bayesian skyline plot) were performed. Divergence time estimates using a calibrated molecular clock were also conducted. Niche modelling was used to reconstruct the palaeodistribution to validate phylogeographical patterns. Results: Thirty haplotypes were identified that clustered into two main lineages, revealing a significant latitudinal phylogeographical break north and south of the Deseado River (c. 47° S). Infra-specific diversification began in the late Miocene, with northern and southern lineages separating c. 3 Ma, after the eastern Patagonian lowlands started to become increasingly arid. Three areas of high molecular diversity were identified: one in southern and two in northern Patagonia where niche modelling indicates that the species may have survived during the Last Glacial Maximum. These putative refugia received more moisture than much of the steppe during glaciation-associated aridization. The south-western refugium is the more likely source for eastward range expansion during post-glacial humidification. Main conclusions: Anarthrophyllum desideratum responded differently to historical processes north and south of the Deseado River. In the north this species survived in situ in fragmented populations, whereas in the south it survived in localized refugia that presumably avoided extreme aridization, and from which it expanded eastwards. For southern Patagonia, our results support a new historical scenario affected more by precipitation regimes than by temperature changes associated with glacial cycles.

From these fossil assemblages, we have inferred diet, resource partitioning and habitat of three sympatric carnivorous mammals based on stable isotopes. The carnivorans include three apex predators: two sabre-toothed cats (Felidae) and a bear dog (Amphicyonidae). Herbivore and carnivore carbon isotope (δ13C) values from tooth enamel imply the presence of a woodland ecosystem dominated by C3 plants. δ13C values and mixing-model analyses suggest that the two sabre-toothed cats, one the size of a leopard and the other the size of a tiger, consumed herbivores with similar δ13C values from a more wooded portion of the ecosystem. The two sabre-toothed cats probably hunted prey of different body sizes, and the smaller species could have used tree cover to avoid encounters with the larger felid. For the bear dog, δ13C values are higher and differ significantly from those of the sabre-toothed cats, suggesting a diet that includes prey from more open woodland. Coexistence of the sabre-toothed cats and the bear dog was likely facilitated by prey capture in different portions of the habitat.

If significant enough, this climatic regime could, in the long term, come to resemble previous greenhouse intervals in earth history. Consequently, analysis of the fossil record during periods of extreme warmth may provide important lessons for species biology, including biogeography, in a much warmer world. To explore this issue, we analyzed the biogeographic response of 63 molluscan species to the long-term global warmth in the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway (WIS) of North America, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to quantitatively measure changes in range size and distribution throughout this interval. We specifically considered the role that geographic range size played in mediating extinction resistance and invasion potential of these WIS species. We found no relationship between geographic range size and survivorship. However, endemic species with small range sizes were more likely to become invasive. Finally, mollusks did not experience a poleward shift in range out of the tropics during this warm regime. To the extent that these patterns are representative, and the WIS and taxa considered constitute a reasonable ancient analogue to a warmer future world, these results suggest that some biogeographic ""rules"" may not prevail under greenhouse conditions of long-term, equable warmth. They also suggest that other factors beyond geographic range size, including distinctive niche characteristics, may play quite important roles in species survival and invasion potential. This potentially complicates predictions regarding the future responses of extant species to long-term warming. © 2013 The Paleontological Society.

In addition, we test whether northern and southern ranges are likely to have experienced similar expansion/contraction dynamics. Location Eastern Australian tropical and subtropical rain forests. Methods Environmental niche modelling was completed for three time periods during the last glacial cycle and was interpreted in light of the known palynology. We collected 109 samples from 32 populations across the entire range of P. elatus. Six microsatellite loci and Bayesian coalescence analysis were used to infer population expansion/contraction dynamics, and five sequenced loci (one plastid and four nuclear) were used to quantify genetic structure/diversity. Results Environmental niche modelling suggested that the northern and southern ranges of P. elatus experienced different expansion/contraction dynamics. In the northern range, the habitat suitable for P. elatus persisted in a small refugial area during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21ka) and then expanded during the post-glacial period. Conversely, in the south suitable habitat was widespread during the LGM but subsequently contracted. These differential dynamics were supported by Bayesian analyses of the population genetic data (northern dispersal) and are consistent with the greater genetic diversity in the south compared with the north. A contact zone between the two genetically divergent groups (corresponding to the Macleay Overlap Zone) was supported by environmental niche modelling and molecular analyses. Main conclusions The climatic fluctuations of the Quaternary have differentially impacted the northern and southern ranges of a broadly distributed rain forest tree in Australia. Recurrent contraction/expansion cycles contributed to the genetic distinction between northern and southern distributions of P. elatus. By combining molecular and environmental niche modelling evidence, this unique study undermines the general assumption that broadly distributed species respond in a uniform way to climate change. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Clarence River Corridor; Environmental niche modelling; Haplotypic diversity; Isolation by distance; Last Glacial Maximum; Macleay Overlap Zone; Palaeodistribution; Podocarpus elatus; Rain forest conifer; Range shifts,climate variation; coniferous forest; demography; ecological modeling; fossil record; genetic analysis; geographical distribution; isolated population; Last Glacial Maximum; latitudinal gradient; niche; paleobotany; paleoclimate; palynology; phylogeography; phytogeography; Postglacial; rainforest; range expansion; refuge; species diversity; succession; vegetation history; Australia; Clarence River [New South Wales]; New South Wales; Coniferophyta; Podocarpus elatus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869866097,,TRUE,

In the current study, we for the first time report microbial fossils from a third type of geothermal sinter, viz. the boron mineral deposits, which are characteristic of the relatively uncommon silicate-poor hot springs. Organic biomarker analyses of the boratic sinters framing the hot springs of Puga valley, Ladakh, identified molecular fossils (viz. respiratory and photosynthetic isoprenoid quinones and photosynthetic pigments) of a mat-like microbial community putatively comprised of algae, fungi, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria, some of which may be proteobacteria.

However, within these groups, there is a wide range of independently derived tooth shapes and lengths, including dirk-tooth and scimitar-tooth morphs. In conjunction with the saberteeth, forelimbs were also used to subdue prey. Thus, there may be a functional link between canine shape and forelimb morphology. Because there are no living sabertooth forms for comparison, extant felids make a good proxy for examining the morphology of these extinct organisms. Here, I examine the forelimb morphology of different sabertooth groups from across North America; I address whether forelimb morphologies are associated with tooth morphologies, and whether these associated tooth and forelimb morphologies are convergent among different families. To answer these questions, I analyzed six functional indices of the forelimbs and two canine characters for 13 species of sabertooth predators and 15 extant felid species. Results indicate that sabertooth morphs with longer, thinner canines show more robust limb proportions. These patterns were convergent among sabertooth felids, nimravids, and barbourofelids, and indicate a positive functional relationship between saber elongation and increased forelimb robustness. This suggests that sabertooth carnivorans demonstrated niche partitioning of predation strategies according to canine shape and corresponding forelimb morphology. © 2012 The Paleontological Society.",,carnivore; convergent evolution; extinction; felid; functional morphology; limb; niche partitioning; paleontology; predation; predator; prey capture; tooth; North America; Felidae; Nimravidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855517462,,FALSE,

However, detailed quantifiable palaeoclimate data are sparse in the region. In particular, reliable palaeoclimatic data are essential to resolve ongoing controversies regarding temperature depression and moisture availability during glacial periods in the sub-continent. Small glaciers close to the glaciation threshold are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation and are therefore ideal indicators of past climatic conditions during their existence. This paper derives some of the first quantitative data on Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) palaeoprecipitation in southern Africa, based on glacier reconstruction and mass balance modelling for the Lesotho Highlands.The reconstruction of former glaciers and their dynamics enables the determination of glacier viability under specific climatic envelopes. Glacier reconstructions at five sites in the Lesotho Highlands yield palaeoglaciers with Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELAs) ranging from 3095 to 3298 m a.s.l., and reconstructed steady-state mass balance and flow dynamics are comparable with modern analogues. Topoclimatic factors are investigated, with temperature-radiation-index modelling indicating that topographic shading was an important factor determining the existence of small glaciers in this region. The occurrence of glaciation in the Drakensberg during the LGM suggests a potential increase in precipitation and change in its seasonality. Such trends are likely associated with an increased frequency of westerly wave (cold front) disturbances due to the northward shift of pressure belts, which would also increase precipitation as snow at higher altitudes. The application of a high resolution climate model (HadAM3h) to test this, displays a change in the seasonal timing of precipitation during the Last Glacial cycle, with a decrease in precipitation evident during the summer months. This is likely to have had important implications for the mass balance and survival of small niche glaciers in the region, with more precipitation falling during the spring - winter - autumn months as snow. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Glacier reconstruction; Lesotho; Niche glaciers; Palaeoclimate; Topographic shading,Climatic conditions; Climatic regimes; Cold front; Equilibrium line altitudes; Flow dynamics; Glacial period; High resolution climate model; Last glacial; Last Glacial Maximum; Late Pleistocene; Lesotho; Mass balance; Modern analogues; Palaeoclimate; Precipitation patterns; Quantitative data; Seasonality; South Africa; Summer months; Temperature depression; Topographic shading; Climate change; Snow; Glacial geology; climate conditions; glaciation; glacier; glaciology; Last Glacial Maximum; mass balance; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; South Africa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867034574,,FALSE,

Here, we assess their role in determining the global distribution and diversity patterns of palms (Arecaceae), a widespread, species-rich group of keystone ecological importance in tropical ecosystems. Location Global. Methods We assembled country-level species lists world-wide and compiled associated data on potential contemporary environmental drivers (current climate, habitat heterogeneity, area, and insularity), Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change and major biogeographic regions to evaluate to what extent the global distribution and species richness patterns in palms reflect Quaternary climatic oscillations or regional effects reflecting pre-Quaternary legacies. We also assessed for the first time if historical legacies differ between continents and islands, providing novel insights into determinants of insular species richness. Results Palm species richness was significantly affected by Quaternary climate changes and further differed between biogeographic regions even when both current environmental conditions and Quaternary climate changes were accounted for. In contrast, global limits to the distribution of the palm family were best explained by current temperature while biogeographic regional differences were unimportant and Quaternary climate change caused only a small constraint. Historical legacies were weak on islands, with only a small regional effect and no effect of Quaternary climate changes. Main conclusions Strong historical legacies supplement current environment as determinants of palm species richness. These primarily comprise pre-Quaternary historical effects, reflected in low African species richness (possibly linked to pre-Quaternary extinctions) and outstandingly high Neotropical and Indomalayan palm species richness (possibly linked to these regions' long-term climatic suitability for palms). In contrast to species richness, the global distribution of the family range is largely in equilibrium with current climate. The small historical effects on islands are consistent with climatic buffering from their oceanic environment. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Monocots; Niche conservatism; Palaeoclimate; Palmae; Plant species diversity; Pleistocene ice ages; Spatial eigenvector filters; Species-energy theory; Tertiary; Tropical rain forest,angiosperm; biogeographical region; climate oscillation; climate variation; eigenvalue; geographical distribution; monocotyledon; niche; paleoclimate; paleoecology; Pleistocene; rainforest; species conservation; species diversity; species richness; Tertiary; Arecaceae; Liliopsida,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860825145,,FALSE,

Green energy clusters are increasingly promoted throughout the world as a strategy to simultaneously promote economic vitality and stimulate a sustainable energy transition. In spite of their emerging role in regional-scale sustainability planning efforts, such initiatives have not been considered within the sustainability transitions literature. This paper explores the development of one such regional sustainable energy cluster initiative in Central Massachusetts in Northeastern USA to consider the potential for such cluster initiatives to contribute to socio-technical transition in the energy system. Since 2008, a diverse set of stakeholders in Central Massachusetts, including politicians, universities, businesses, local citizens, and activists, have been working toward facilitating the emergence of an integrated cluster of activity focused on sustainable energy. Through interviews with key actors, participant observation, and document review, this research assesses the potential of this cluster initiative to contribute to a regional socio-technical transition. The empirical details of this case demonstrate that sustainable energy cluster initiatives can potentially accelerate change in entrenched energy regimes by promoting institutional thickness, generating regional 'buzz' around sustainable energy activities, and building trust between multiple and diverse stakeholders in the region.

Our study system comprised two closely related species of Alpine Primula. We used species distribution models based on the extant distribution of the species and last glacial maximum (LGM) climate models to predict the distribution of the two species during the LGM. Phylogeographic data were generated using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). In Primula hirsuta,models of past distribution and phylogeographic data are partly congruent and support the hypothesis ofwidespread nunatak survival in the Central Alps. Species distribution models (SDMs) allowed us to differentiate between alpine regions that harbor potential nunatak areas and regions that have been colonized fromother areas. SDMs revealed that diversity is a good indicator for nunataks, while rarity is a good indicator for peripheral relict populations that were not source for the recolonization of the inner Alps. In P. daonensis, palaeodistribution models and phylogeographic data are incongruent. Besides the uncertainty inherent to this type of modeling approach (e.g., relatively coarse 1-km grain size), disagreement of models and data may partly be caused by shifts of ecological niche in both species.Nevertheless,we demonstrate that the combination of palaeodistribution modeling with phylogeographical approaches provides a more differentiated picture of the distributional history of species and partly supports (P. hirsuta) and partly modifies (P. daonensis and P. hirsuta) hypotheses of Quaternary distributional history.

However, many of the assumptions of SDMs may be violated when they are used to project species distributions across significant climate change events. In particular, SDM's in theory assume stable fundamental niches, but in practice, they assume stable realized niches. The assumption of a fixed realized niche relative to climate variables remains unlikely for various reasons, particularly if novel future climates open up currently unavailable portions of species' fundamental niches. To demonstrate this effect, we compare the climate distributions for fossil-pollen data from 21 to 15 ka bp (relying on paleoclimate simulations) when communities and climates with no modern analog were common across North America to observed modern pollen assemblages. We test how well SDMs are able to project 20th century pollen-based taxon distributions with models calibrated using data from 21 to 15 ka. We find that taxa which were abundant in areas with no-analog late glacial climates, such as Fraxinus, Ostrya/Carpinus and Ulmus, substantially shifted their realized niches from the late glacial period to present. SDMs for these taxa had low predictive accuracy when projected to modern climates despite demonstrating high predictive accuracy for late glacial pollen distributions. For other taxa, e.g. Quercus, Picea, Pinus strobus, had relatively stable realized niches and models for these taxa tended to have higher predictive accuracy when projected to present. Our findings reinforce the point that a realized niche at any one time often represents only a subset of the climate conditions in which a taxon can persist. Projections from SDMs into future climate conditions that are based solely on contemporary realized distributions are potentially misleading for assessing the vulnerability of species to future climate change. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Hindcasting; Niche shift; Niche stability; No-analog climate; North america; Paleo-climate; Pollen; Quaternary,angiosperm; climate conditions; climate variation; deciduous tree; forecasting method; hindcasting; modeling; niche overlap; paleoclimate; palynology; Quaternary; spatial distribution; twenty first century; North America; Fraxinus; Picea; Pinus strobus; Quercus; Ulmus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862829674,,TRUE,*

Location Global. Methods The phylogenetic tree used in the analysis was a family-level tree estimated from previously published nuclear DNA sequence data. Each family for which a thorough and taxonomically well-sampled phylogenetic analysis exists was subject to an initial dispersal-vicariance analysis in order to reconstruct ancestral areas for its two most basal lineages. Both basal lineages were then used to represent the family in the subsequent reconstruction of ancestral distributions for the entire radiation. Results The analysis showed that three reciprocally monophyletic groups of terrestrial birds have diversified in the Gondwanan land areas of Australia, South America and Africa, respectively. Although each of these three groups may also have originally included other groups, the only survivors today from the Australian radiation are the passerines and parrots, while the falcons and seriemas have survived from the South American radiation. The group of survivors from the African radiation is considerably more taxonomically diverse and includes all coraciiform and piciform birds, owls, diurnal raptors (except falcons), New World vultures, trogons, mousebirds and cuckoo-rollers. Main conclusions The outlined evolutionary scenario with three geographically isolated clades of terrestrial birds is consistent with the available estimates of Late Cretaceous to early Palaeogene dates for these radiations. The diversifications and ecological adaptations within each of the three groups most likely took place in isolation on the different continents.

Location The case study focuses on Late Ordovician articulate brachiopods of the Cincinnati Arch in eastern North America. Methods Species niches were modelled for a suite of fossil brachiopod species based on five environmental variables inferred from sedimentary parameters using GARP and Maxent. Niche stability was assessed by comparison of (1) the degree of overlap of species distribution models developed for a time-slice and those generated by projecting niche models of the previous time-slice onto environmental layers of a second time-slice using GARP and Maxent, (2) Schoener's D statistic, and (3) the similarity of the contribution of each environmental parameter within Maxent niche models between adjacent time-slices. Results Late Ordovician brachiopod species conserved their niches with high fidelity during intervals of gradual environmental change but responded to inter-basinal species invasions through niche evolution. Both native and invasive species exhibited similar levels of niche evolution in the invasion and post-invasion intervals. Niche evolution was related mostly to decreased variance within the former ecological niche parameters rather than to shifts to new ecospace. Main conclusions Although the species examined exhibited morphological stasis during the study interval, high levels of niche conservatism were observed only during intervals of gradual environmental change. Rapid environmental change, notably inter-basinal species invasions, resulted in high levels of niche evolution among the focal taxa. Both native and invasive species responded with similar levels of niche evolution during the invasion interval and subsequent environmental reorganization. The assumption of complete niche conservatism frequently employed in ecological niche modelling (ENM) analyses to forecast or hindcast species geographical distributions is more likely to be accurate for climate change studies than for invasive species analyses over geological time-scales. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Eastern North America; GARP; Invasive species; Maxent; Niche conservatism; Niche evolution; Palaeobiogeography; Palaeoecology,brachiopod; evolutionary biology; fossil record; geographical distribution; hindcasting; invasive species; niche partitioning; Ordovician; paleobiogeography; paleobiology; paleoecology; timescale; Cincinnati; Ohio; United States; Brachiopoda,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858699227,,TRUE,

Mammalian biodiversity in South America can be partitioned into three major phases, beginning in the Paleocene (65.5-55.8 million years ago - Ma) with xenarthrans, notoungulates, marsupials, and ending with the Great American Interchange that occurred with the influx of North American mammals upon formation of the Panamanian land bridge approximately 3 Ma (Simpson 1980; Marshall 1988; Flynn and Wyss 1998). South America's first rodents, the New World Hystricognathi (Caviomorpha), termed old native rodents by Simpson (1980) appear in the fossil record around 37.5-31 Ma in the Eocene/Oligocene transition (Wyss et al. 1993; Vucetich et al. 1999; Flynn et al. 2003). The origin of South American caviomorph rodents is apparently a consequence of over-water dispersal from Africa during the Late Paleocene (c.58 Ma) to Middle Eocene (c.40 Ma; Lavocat 1969, 1980; Huchon and Douzery 2001; Rowe 2002; Rowe et al. 2010). The Late Eocene to Early Oligocene of South America represents a period of transition in terms of climatic and environmental changes (Flynn and Wyss 1998). According to both Mares and Ojeda (1982) and Simpson (1980), caviomorph rodents during this time period experienced an adaptive radiation that resulted in these hypsodont herbivores (herbivores with high-crowned cheek teeth) filling niches previously occupied by archaic ungulates from the first phase of mammalian history in South America (Flynn and Wyss 1998). One particular Pliocene/Pleistocene (4-2 Ma) form, Josephoartigasia monesi, was the size of a rhinoceros and adapted for a semiaquatic life style (Rinderknecht and Blanco 2008).

Location Western North America. Methods We analysed complete cytochrome b gene (1143bp) sequences from 182 specimens of N. cinerea using Bayesian and coalescent methods to infer phylogenetic relationships, time of major divergences, and recent demographic trends. For comparison, we developed clade-specific ecological niche models for groups of interest and analysed spatial trends of N. cinerea in the palaeorecord as well as temporal frequency trends across strata of individual palaeomiddens. Results We found two largely allopatric clades within N. cinerea, with several regionally distinct subclades showing contrasting recent population dynamics. Niche models showed consistent habitat at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and modern times in the Rocky Mountains and northern United States, while the Great Basin may have been markedly less suitable at the LGM than today. The palaeorecord showed great spatio-temporal variability in the presence of N. cinerea, but documents broad-scale patterns of occupancy and regional population trends. Main conclusions The Quaternary dynamics and evolutionary history of N. cinerea appear to have been shaped by both vicariant events associated with geographical barriers and the availability of suitable habitat through time. Divergence of the two major clades dates to the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition, with clades separated by the Green and Colorado rivers and northern Rocky Mountain Pleistocene glaciations. We found largely concordant genetic, niche model and palaeorecord patterns suggesting long-term population stability in the Rocky Mountains, while extant clades in the Great Basin and far north appear to have expanded or re-expanded into these regions relatively recently. Furthermore, disjunct haplotype distributions, regional demographic history, and historical distribution of suitable habitat suggest that the Great Basin has been a particularly dynamic region. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Divergence dating; Ecological niche model; Great Basin; Mitochondrial DNA; Montane; Neotoma cinerea; Palaeomidden; Phylogeography; Quaternary; Western North America,allopatry; biogeography; cladistics; climate change; dating method; demography; divergence; ecological modeling; gene expression; genetic analysis; habitat availability; habitat type; Last Glacial Maximum; niche; paleoenvironment; physiological response; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; population distribution; population dynamics; Quaternary; reconstruction; rodent; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; stabilization; vicariance; Colorado River [North America]; Great Basin; United States; Cricetidae; Neotoma; Neotoma cinerea; Rodentia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855820316,,TRUE,*

Location Western North America. Methods Phylogenetic relationships were determined by analysing the two ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) in MrBayes. Divergence dates were estimated for major nodes using two different molecular dating analyses: a penalized likelihood approach to rate smoothing using the program r8s, and a Bayesian MCMC averaging approach to rate smoothing using the program beast. Both analyses were calibrated using fossils from Dominican amber. Haplotype networks were estimated using tcs. Ecological niche models (ENMs) were developed using six bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim data set in the program Maxent. Results The phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that S. arota can be split into four deeply divergent lineages that probably represent distinct species. No morphological characters were found that can be used to identify these four species, making the S. arota species complex the first documented cryptic species complex in the family Mutillidae. Ecological niche models provide estimated distributions, which indicate that each of the four species inhabits a distinct niche. Divergence date estimates suggest that major diversification events occurred in the late Neogene. Main conclusions Sphaeropthalma arota is composed of four genetically distinct species that cannot be distinguished morphologically based on current methods. We suggest that the members of this group be identified as the S. arota species complex. Major diversification events in this species complex can be linked to late Neogene mountain building and aridification events, specifically the uplift of the mountain ranges in southern California and the expansion of the Bouse Sea. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Desert biogeography; Historical ecology; Late Neogene uplift; Phylogeography; Species distribution models; Sphaeropthalminae; Velvet ants; Vicariance; Western North America,ant; arid environment; bioclimatology; crypsis; data set; dating method; historical ecology; morphology; mountain region; Neogene; niche breadth; phylogenetics; phylogeography; range expansion; vicariance; California; United States; Hymenoptera; Mutillidae; Sphaeropthalma; Sphaeropthalminae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855803235,,TRUE,

Specifically, we ask: (1) do climate conditions with no modern analogue negatively affect the accuracy of ecosystem reconstructions? (2) are bioclimate envelope model projections biased towards under-predicting forested ecosystems? (3) given a palaeoecological perspective, are potential habitat projections for the 21st century within model capabilities? Location Western North America. Methods We used an ensemble classifier modelling approach (RandomForest) to spatially project the climate space of modern ecosystem classes throughout the Holocene (at 6000, 9000, 11,000, 14,000, 16,000, and 21,000 YBP) using palaeoclimate surfaces generated by two general circulation models (GFDL and CCM1). The degree of novel arrangement of climate variables was quantified with the multivariate Mahalanobis distance to the nearest modern climatic equivalent. Model projections were validated against biome classifications inferred from 1460 palaeoecological records. Results Model accuracy assessed against independent palaeoecology data is generally low for the present day, increases for 6000 YBP, and then rapidly declines towards the last glacial maximum, primarily due to the under-prediction of forested biomes. Misclassifications were closely correlated with the degree of climate dissimilarity from the present day. For future projections, no-analogue climates unexpectedly emerged in the coastal Pacific Northwest but were absent throughout the rest of the study area. Main conclusions Bioclimate envelope models could approximately reconstruct ecosystem distributions for the mid- to late-Holocene but proved unreliable in the Late Pleistocene. We attribute this failure to a combination of no-analogue climates and a potential lack of niche conservatism in tree species. However, climate dissimilarities in future projections are comparatively minor (similar to those of the mid-Holocene), and we conclude that no-analogue climates should not compromise the accuracy of model predictions for the next century. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Bioclimate envelope models; Climate change; Climate dissimilarity; Ecological niche models; Extinction risk; Holocene; Niche conservatism; No-analogue climate; RandomForest; Western North America,bioclimatology; biome; climate variation; ensemble forecasting; general circulation model; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; multivariate analysis; numerical model; paleoclimate; paleoecology,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855540491,,TRUE,*

The human impact on the benthic environment is assessed to be predominantly high to very high, including shipping, selective extraction (demersal fishing and aggregates), and obstruction (cables, wrecks), among others. Biological communities were compared across the three main geomorphic features, namely flat seabed, bedrock ridges and the palaeovalley, considering both the taxa recorded and the biotopes identified during the video analysis. Sixty-two taxa were identified to various levels of taxonomic precision and the analysis presented here is based on their relative frequency of occurrence. Geophysical and biological analysis revealed an extensive system of rock ridges located 30 km south of the Isle of Wight in water depths ranging between 40 and 80 m below Chart Datum. The feature extends 100 km in an east-west direction and 15 km in a north-south direction, covering ca. 1,100 km2 of seafloor. The rock habitat supports a substantial coverage of fauna including sponges, bryozoans, hydroids and anemones.

Dental abrasion was significantly lower in the insular bovid than in highly hypsodont continental artiodactyls, suggesting that feeding habits are not the sole driving force behind increased crown height.

In temnocyonines, we see the first carnivorans to occupy an ecological niche as large cursorial predators. The subfamily is confined to the Arikareean NALMA, ranging in age from the latest early Oligocene to the early Miocene. Distributed from the Pacific Northwest to the Great Plains and Florida, there are four genera (Temnocyon, Mammacyon, Delotrochanter n. gen., Rudiocyon n. gen.) and 12 species, of which eight are newly described (Temnocyon subferox, T. fingeruti, T. macrogenys; Rudiocyon amplidens; Mammacyon ferocior; Delotrochanter petersoni, D. oryktes, D. major). Among the specimens examined are eight skulls, three with intact basicranial morphology that establish the presence of a plesiomorphic arctoid auditory region in the subfamily. Temnocyonine dentitions and postcranial skeletons reveal a blend of morphological characteristics not previously nor subsequently seen among the Carnivora. From a stem species, Temnocyon altigenis, there evolve both large hypercarnivorous (Temnocyon) and durophagous forms (Mammacyon, Delotrochanter); these genera share a derived dentition that defines the Temnocyoninae. Delotrochanter oryktes n. sp., an early Miocene species, was found in a den, suggesting a possible burrowing capability and sheltering of offspring. The John Day basin of Oregon and the central Great Plains (western Nebraska, southeast Wyoming) are the source of most temnocyonine fossils; a few have been found in southern California and Florida, indicative of a continent-wide distribution. Temnocyonines have often been confused with canids, however their basicranial anatomy places them securely within the Amphicyonidae. First discovered in the 1870s, only ∼30 individuals comprise the entire record of the subfamily. Many were found in proximity to radioisotopically calibrated tuffs and ignimbrites and/or were closely associated with mammals of established biochronologic age. Thus, most species can be placed in a temporal context. With rare exception, the fossils represent isolated occurrences, hence estimates of variation within a population are lacking. Cursorial postcranial features characterize several lineages (Mammacyon, Delotrochanter) and probably were present in other temnocyonines known only from dental remains. Late Oligocene Mammacyon ferocior and early Miocene Delotrochanter oryktes evolved uniquely configured crushing cheek teeth and cursorial limbs, combining distinctive dental and skeletal traits in a manner not seen in any living carnivore. These species are interpreted as large durophagous predators with craniodental characteristics that parallel living hyaenids (Crocuta crocuta) and postcranial adaptations approaching those of cursorial canids such as the wolf (Canis lupus). Expansion of semiarid grasslands and savanna during the late Oligocene and early Miocene in the central Great Plains seems to have favored the evolution of these wide-ranging durophagous amphicyonid carnivores. Analysis of the jaws of temnocyonines employing Therrien's method of beam analysis demonstrates pronounced bending strength focused beneath the crushing dental battery in the molar region. Similarly, the canines and mandibular symphysis manifest an ability to resist strong parasagittal, transverse, and torsional forces occurring during prey capture and feeding. Temnocyonines share a pronounced similarity in dentition with European haplocyonine beardogs, which doubtless are their sister group among the Amphicyonidae. Some haplocyonines also show cursorial tendencies. Examination of European material, however, reveals subtle dental distinctions indicating that the evolution of the two subfamilies proceeded separately yet in parallel in Europe and North America.

Methods Phylogenetic relationships were investigated using partial sequences of the nuclear genes c-mos, RAG-1 and Zenk of 75 parrot and 21 other avian taxa. Divergence dates and confidence intervals were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach. Biogeographic patterns were evaluated taking temporal connectivity between areas into account. We tested whether diversification remained constant over time and if some parrot groups were more species-rich than expected given their age. Results Crown group diversification of parrots started only about 58Ma, in the Palaeogene, significantly later than previously thought. The Australasian lories and possibly also the Neotropical Arini were found to be unexpectedly species-rich. Diversification rates probably increased around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary and in the middle Miocene, during two periods of major global climatic aberrations characterized by global cooling. Main conclusions The diversification of parrots was shaped by climatic and geological events as well as by key innovations. Initial vicariance events caused by continental break-up were followed by transoceanic dispersal and local radiations. Habitat shifts caused by climate change and mountain orogenesis may have acted as a catalyst to the diversification by providing new ecological opportunities and challenges as well as by causing isolation as a result of habitat fragmentation. The lories constitute the only highly nectarivorous parrot clade, and their diet shift, associated with morphological innovation, may have acted as an evolutionary key innovation, allowing them to explore underutilized niches and promoting their diversification. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Dispersal; Diversification; Gondwana; Historical biogeography; Key innovation; Molecular clock; Molecular phylogeny; Psittaciformes; Vicariance,Bayesian analysis; bird; climate variation; dietary shift; Eocene-Oligocene boundary; evolutionary biology; fossil record; Gondwana; habitat fragmentation; habitat selection; Miocene; paleoclimate; phylogenetics; phylogeny; spatiotemporal analysis; species richness; vicariance; New Zealand; Aves; Loriidae; Psittacidae; Psittaciformes,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053930948,,FALSE,

Alternatively, the geographic range would not necessarily shift if a species can adapt in situ to a changing environment. The potential for a species to persist in place might increase with the diversity of habitat types that a species exploits. We evaluate evidence for either range shift or range stability between the last glacial maximum (LGM) and present time in the chisel-toothed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys microps), an endemic of the Great Basin and Mojave deserts. We modeled how the species' range would have changed if the climatic niche of the species remained conserved between the LGM and present time. The climatic models imply that if D. microps inhabited the same climatic niche during the LGM as it does today, the species would have persisted primarily within the warm Mojave Desert and expanded northwards into the cold Great Basin only after the LGM. Contrary to the climatic models, the mitochondrial DNA assessment revealed signals of population persistence within the current distribution of the species throughout at least the latest glacial-interglacial cycle. We concluded that D. microps did not track its climatic niche during late Pleistocene oscillations, but rather met the challenge of a changing environment by shifting its niche and retaining large portions of its distribution. We speculate that this kind of response to fluctuating climate was possible because of 'niche drifting', an alteration of the species' realized niche due to plasticity in various biological characters. Our study provides an example of an approach to reconstruct species' responses to past climatic changes that can be used to evaluate whether and to what extent taxa have capacity to shift their niches in response to the changing environment - information becoming increasingly important to predicting biotic responses to future environmental changes. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Climatic niche; Great Basin; Last glacial maximum; Niche shift; Phylogeography; Range expansion,climate effect; climate modeling; climate variation; glacial-interglacial cycle; Last Glacial Maximum; mitochondrial DNA; niche overlap; paleoclimate; phylogeography; range expansion; reconstruction; rodent; Great Basin; Mojave Desert; United States; Dipodomys; Dipodomys microps; Rattus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053492055,,TRUE,

However, there is an ongoing discussion in the literature about whether this approach could become more sensitive at detecting past environmental changes if paleolimnologists conducted finer taxonomic analyses of their specimens. To advance this discussion, we conducted comparative analyses of larval chironomid assemblages resolved to two levels of taxonomic resolution. For this exercise, we chose to use live assemblages (as opposed to sub-fossil assemblages) because fine taxonomic resolution of live assemblages is more easily obtained. Our specific aims were to (i) determine if finely resolved taxa comprising a coarsely resolved group have similar ecological niches, (ii) determine if different environmental predictors of community composition are identified when two different levels of taxonomic resolution are applied and (iii) evaluate whether the variance explained by environmental variables differs substantially between levels of taxonomic resolution. We found that there was substantial dispersion among finely resolved taxa belonging to a single coarse group, which suggests that the merging of these taxa results in the loss of ecological information, and therefore warrants higher taxonomic precision. However, the identification of significant environmental predictors and the proportion of variance explained by these did not differ greatly between our two levels of taxonomic resolution. Overall our results show that coarse-resolution analyses may be adequate for some applications, but if the aim is to infer subtle environmental changes (as is the case in most paleolimnological studies) we recommend the highest possible level of taxonomic resolution. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Bioindicators; Calibration sets; Chironomids; Multivariate analyses; Paleolimnology; Taxonomic resolution,Chironomids; Community analysis; Community composition; Comparative analysis; Ecological information; Ecological niche; Environmental change; Environmental conditions; Environmental variables; Multi variate analysis; Paleolimnology; Proportion of variance; Taxonomic resolution; Air pollution control; Ecology; Multivariant analysis; benthos; bioindicator; calibration; community composition; comparative study; ecological approach; environmental conditions; fossil assemblage; insect; multivariate analysis; paleolimnology; taxonomy; Chironomidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958125204,,FALSE,*

Both species have small populations in the Iberian Peninsula that are isolated by more than 1000km from their nearest conspecifics. Because these species possess similar ecological preferences and geographical distributions, they are excellent candidates for congruent biogeographical histories. Location The Palaearctic region, with a special focus on the Mediterranean peninsulas as glacial refugia. Methods We integrated phylogeography and population genetic analyses with ecological niche modelling. The mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the non-coding nuclear marker internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) were analysed for 62 specimens of P. cinarae and for 80 of P. sidae to infer phylogeography and to date the origin of disjunct distributions. Current and ancestral [Last Glacial Maximum using MIROC (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate) and CCSM (Community Climate System Model) circulation models] distribution models were calculated with Maxent. Using present climatic conditions, we delimited the ecological space for each species. Results The genetic structure and potential ancestral distribution of the two species were markedly different. While the Iberian population of P. cinarae had an old origin (c.1Ma), that of P. sidae was closely related to French and Italian lineages (which jointly diverged from eastern populations c.0.27Ma). Ecological niche modelling showed that minor differences in the ecological preferences of the two species seem to account for their drastically different distributional response to the last glacial to post-glacial environmental conditions. Although the potential distribution of P. cinarae was largely unaffected by climate change, suitable habitat for P. sidae strongly shifted in both elevation and latitude. This result might explain the early origin of the disjunct distribution of P. cinarae, in contrast to the more recent disjunction of P. sidae. Main conclusions We show that convergent biogeographical patterns can be analysed with a combination of genetic and ecological niche modelling data. The results demonstrate that species with similar distributional patterns and ecology may still have different biogeographical histories, highlighting the importance of including the temporal dimension when studying biogeographical patterns. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biogeography; COI; Disjunct distribution; Ecology; ITS2; Lepidoptera; Niche modelling; Palaearctic region; Palaeoclimate; Phylogeography,butterfly; conspecific; convergent evolution; disjunct distribution; ecological modeling; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genetic structure; geographical distribution; isolated population; Last Glacial Maximum; Palearctic Region; paleoclimate; phylogeography; preference behavior; relatedness; zoogeography; Mediterranean Region; Hesperioidea; Lepidoptera; Papilionoidea; Pyrgus,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052710711,,TRUE,

Furthermore, we compare the geographical patterns of muscid phylogenetic structure with biogeographical regions that have been identified for Neotropical insects. Location Central and South America. Methods We modelled the geographic distributions of 658 species using Maxent and 19 environmental variables. A generic-level supertree of the Muscidae was assembled using matrix representation with parsimony and used to map the geographic pattern of mean root distance (MRD), a metric of the relative evolutionary development of assemblages. Regression models (ordinary least squares and regression trees) were used to examine temperature and other environmental correlates of MRD to explore potential environmental drivers of muscid diversification. We used the regression tree results to recognize variable intervals that best explained MRD, and these intervals were mapped to recognize and compare with biogeographical regions of Neotropical insects. Results The geographic pattern of MRD was consistent with the tropical conservatism hypothesis: species in genera that diversified relatively early, as measured by their distance from the tree root, dominate lowland tropical South America, whereas species in genera that diversified more recently occupy extra-tropical areas, sub-Antarctic areas and the Andean highlands. Temperature was the strongest correlate of MRD. Three biogeographical regions were recognized and they coincided with two regions known for insects. Main conclusions Evolutionary responses of muscid flies to post-Eocene climate change taking the form of an expansion of a tropical group into regions with colder climates may be fundamental to explaining their distribution in the Neotropics. Our biogeographical regions delimited by temperature and the phylogenetic metric, surrogates of the tropical conservatism hypothesis, were very similar to general insect patterns, supporting the 'tropical origin and evolutionary response to climate cooling' as a broadly based historical narrative for the Neotropics. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biogeographical regions; Cenozoic; Central America; Climate change; Eocene; Historical biogeography; Maxent; Muscidae; South America; Supertree,biogeography; Cenozoic; climate change; conservation management; ecological modeling; Eocene; fly; geographical distribution; identification method; matrix; Neotropical Region; niche; paleoenvironment; parsimony analysis; phylogenetics; range expansion; regression analysis; species diversity; tropical environment; South America; Hexapoda; Muscidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052697118,,TRUE,

One of these phyla is Chaetognatha, a group of predatory marine worms. Given their role as major predators in modern planktonic ecosystems, the chaetognaths discovered in the Maotianshan Shale (Yunnan Province, South China) suggest that the pelagos at the time was already quite complex. Modern chaetognaths, however, can be divided into benthic and pelagic forms; the pelagic nature of Eognathacantha ercainella should therefore be validated by strong morphological evidence. Knowing that planktonic animals present morphological adaptations that increase their buoyancy, we studied the drag produced during the active phase of chaetognath locomotion for the modern forms Paraspadella gotoi (benthic) and Sagitta elegans (pelagic). By using a motion model developed by Jordan in 1992, we could calculate the resistive force produced by the undulatory movement of chaetognaths' bodies. This mechanistic approach evaluates the effect of three motion parameters (relative speed, total length, and tail ratio) on the drag force produced during locomotion. Our results show that the increase of size contributes to higher drag while the shorter tail of the pelagic form balances this effect by reducing the wetted surface subject to friction. For chaetognaths, therefore, a bigger body (both in length and width) and a shorter tail indicate a pelagic lifestyle, a finding that can be applied to the study of the fossil Eognathacantha ercainella. A discriminant analysis can confirm that the Early Cambrian chaetognath presents a pelagic morphology with similarities to modern bathypelagic and mesopelagic species. © 2011 The Paleontological Society.

Location Sixty-three natural protected areas in Asia, Africa and South and Central America. Methods We defined faunal communities by allocating species to ecological guilds and calculating proportional representation within each guild. Vegetation heterogeneity for each natural protected area was calculated from satellite images. The relationship between these ecospaces was calculated using canonical correlations analysis, redundancy analysis and principal components analysis. We expected that large, herbivorous mammals would be most strongly correlated with open areas. Convergence was tested by independently eliminating the effects of geography and vegetation heterogeneity on the structure of the mammal communities. We expected that vegetation would more strongly structure communities than geographical position. Results We show that the guild structure of communities across habitats is significantly correlated with vegetation heterogeneity. The highest correlation was between small, scansorial-arboreal secondary consumers and heavy tree cover. The first convergence analysis shows American communities distinguished from Asian and African communities; these latter communities show a remarkable convergence in structure. Historical factors only affected the continent whose mammals had experienced a long period of isolation. The second convergence analysis shows that almost all biomes have the same or very similar community structure regardless of continent. Main conclusions Communities from the same environments in different continents showed remarkable convergence. Communities from the same continents only converged when those continents shared a recent geological and biological history. These results suggest that historical and environmental factors are operating over different timescales. This study confirms that environmental reconstructions made on the basis of whole communities will accurately reflect the environment that the community lived in. However, reconstructions made for fossil sites in deep time need to take historical factors into consideration. Small, arboreal and scansorial secondary consumers show the strongest correlation with vegetation, correlating with continuous tree canopy cover. This relationship allows simple reconstructions of the amount of tree cover occurring in a landscape from the proportion of species from the community falling in this ecological guild. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Africa; America; Asia; Community convergence; Guild; Niche; Palaeoecology; Synecology,arboreal species; community structure; correlation; environmental factor; heterogeneity; landscape structure; mammal; paleoecology; principal component analysis; protected area; satellite imagery; vegetation; Africa; Asia; Central America; South America; Mammalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961190483,,FALSE,

We quantified richness and its relationships with current climatic conditions by gridding species' range maps at 110×110km. Also, dated phylogenies and palaeoclimatic reconstructions, coupled with evidence from the fossil record, were used to approximate the areas and climate characteristics in which each group originated and/or radiated.

Dietary reconstructions inferred from stable isotopes of both genera of horses present in South America document dietary separation and environmental changes in ancient ecosystems, including C3/C4transitions. Stable isotope data demonstrate changes in C4grass consumption, inter-species dietary partitioning and variation in isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders with latitudinal gradient.Conclusions: The data for Hippidion indicate a preference varying from C3plants to mixed C3-C4plants in their diet. Equus (Amerhippus) shows three different patterns of dietary partitioning Equus (A.) neogeus from the province of Buenos Aires indicate a preference for C3plants in the diet. Equus (A.) andium from Ecuador and Equus (A.) insulatus from Bolivia show a preference for to a diet of mixed C3-C4plants, while Equus (A.) santaeelenae from La Carolina (sea level of Ecuador) and Brazil are mostly C4feeders. These results confirm that ancient feeding ecology cannot always be inferred from dental morphology. While the carbon isotope composition of horses skeletal material decreased as latitude increased, we found evidence of boundary between a mixed C3/C4diet signal and a pure C4signal around 32° S and a change from a mixed diet signal to an exclusively C3signal around 35°S.We found that the horses living at high altitudes and at low to middle latitude still have a C4component in their diet, except the specimens from 4000 m, which have a pure C3diet. The change in altitudinal vegetation gradients during the Pleistocene is one of several possibilities to explain the C4dietary component in horses living at high altitudes. Other alternative explanations imply that the horses fed partially at lower altitudes. © 2011 Prado et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",C4 plants; Horses; Mammals; South America; Stable Isotopes,bone; dentition; diet; feeding ecology; fossil; horse; isotopic ratio; latitudinal gradient; morphology; paleoecology; plant; Pleistocene; Pliocene; preference behavior; skeletal remains; stable isotope; tooth; South America; Amerhippus; Equidae; Equus; Equus insulatus; Equus neogeus; Hippidion; Mammalia; carbon; oxygen; animal; article; biodiversity; bone; chemistry; diet; feeding behavior; fossil; horse; metabolism; methodology; paleontology; Poaceae; radiometric dating; South America; tooth; Animals; Biodiversity; Bone and Bones; Carbon Isotopes; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Fossils; Horses; Oxygen Isotopes; Paleontology; Poaceae; Radiometric Dating; South America; Tooth,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958253243,,FALSE,

Although this pattern is widely reported in different carnivoran families, the mechanisms driving the evolution of carnivoran skull morphology remain largely unexplored. In this study we use coordinate-point extended eigenshape analysis (CP-EES) to summarize aspects of skull shape in large fissiped carnivores. Results of these comparisons enable the evaluation of the role of different factors constraining the evolution of carnivoran skull design. Empirical morphospaces derived from mandible anatomy show that all hypercarnivores (i.e., those species with a diet that consists almost entirely of vertebrate flesh) share a set of traits involved in a functional compromise between bite force and gape angle, which is reflected in a strong pattern of morphological convergence. Although the paths followed by different taxa to reach this ""hypercarnivore shape-space"" differ because of phylogenetic constraints, the morphological signature of hypercarnivory in the mandible is remarkably narrow and well constrained. In contrast, CP-EES of cranial morphology does not reveal a similar pattern of shape convergence among hypercarnivores. This suggests a lesser degree of morphological plasticity in the cranium compared to the mandible, which probably results from a compromise between different functional demands in the cranium (e.g., feeding, vision, olfactory sense, and brain processing) whereas the mandible is only involved in food acquisition and processing. Combined analysis of theoretical and empirical morphospaces for these skull data also show the lower anatomical disparity of felids and hyaenids compared to canids and ursids. This indicates that increasing specialization within the hypercarnivorous niche may constrain subsequent morphological and ecological flexibility. During the Cenozoic, similar skull traits appeared in different carnivoran lineages, generated by similar selection pressures (e.g., toward hypercarnivory) and shared developmental pathways. These pathways were likely the proximate source of constraints on the degree of variation associated with carnivoran skull evolution and on its direction. © 2011 The Paleontological Society.

Despite the very fine grain size of these tephra (mostly less than 20 microns), robust geochemical compositions were determined by electron microprobe analysis. The source volcanoes for these tephra layers are largely found within the Antarctic plate. Statistical geochemical correlations tie nine of the tephra layers to known eruptions from Mt.

The lowest tephra layer in the ice core, located at 986.21 m depth, is correlated to a source eruption with an age of 118.1 ± 1.3 ka, suggesting a chronological pinning point for the lower ice. An episode of anomalously high volcanic activity in the ice in the SDM-A core between 18 and 35 ka (Gow and Meese, 2007) appears to be related to eruptive activity of Mt. Berlin volcano. At least some of the tephra layers found in the SDM-A core appear to be the result of very explosive eruptions that spread ash across large parts of West Antarctica, off the West Antarctic coast, as well as also being recognized in East Antarctica (Basile et al., 2001; Narcisi et al., 2005, 2006). Some of these layers would be expected to should be found in other deep Antarctic ice cores, particularly ones drilled in West Antarctica, providing correlative markers between different cores. The analysis of the tephra layers in the Siple Dome core, along with other Antarctic cores, provides a timing framework for the relatively proximal Antarctic and South American volcanic eruptive events, allowing these to be distinguished from the tropical eruptions that may play a greater role in climate forcing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,Antarctic coasts; Antarctic ice core; Antarctica; Climate forcings; East antarctica; Electron microprobe analysis; Eruptive activity; Eruptive events; Explosive eruption; Fine grains; Geochemical composition; Geochemical correlation; Ice core; Large parts; Pinning points; Siple dome; South America; Tephra layers; Tephrochronology; Volcanic activities; Volcanic eruptions; Analytical geochemistry; Domes; Electron probe microanalysis; Glacial geology; Stratigraphy; Volcanoes; Ice; chemical composition; climate forcing; dome; electron probe analysis; geomorphology; grain size; ice core; paleoclimate; tephra; tephrochronology; volcanic eruption; Aisen; Antarctica; Chile; Mount Berlin; Mount Hudson; Mount Takahe; Siple Dome; Southern Volcanic Zone; West Antarctica; Porphyrio mantelli,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957987121,,FALSE,

The incomplete chrono-stratigraphy of this vast region does not allow to accept the direct chronological correlation between the available sites and events of faunal and hominin dispersals from Africa. It also demonstrates that hominins survived in a mixed landscape of open parkland with forested surrounding hills. In addition, the prevailing environmental conditions are not sufficient to explain successful adaptations to new ecological niches away from the African savanna of the bearers of 'core and flake' and the Acheulian industries, The differences in knapping and secondary shaping of stone artifacts probably reflect the learned traditions of different groups of hominins. The current distribution of lithic industries across Eurasia is undoubtedly incomplete due to lack of cultural continuities as well as paucity of field research in several sub-regions. This observation supports the contention that what we view as a constant stream of migrants was actually interrupted many times. The continuous occupation of southwestern Asia by the makers of the Acheulian is in contrast with neighboring regions such as the Iranian plateau and Eastern Europe.

We have shown how an ecological niche model (ENM) based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions of sea surface temperature and bathymetry can be used to effectively predict the spatial range of marine fish during the LGM. The results indicate that the ranges of marine fish species now in northwestern Europe were displaced significantly southwards from the modern distribution, challenging an existing paradigm of marine glacial refugia. The model presents strong evidence that there was an invasion of important fish through the Straits of Gibraltar in glacial times, where they were exploited by Palaeolithic human populations around the western Mediterranean Sea. The ENM results are important for ongoing studies of molecular ecology that aim to assess marine glacial refugia from the genetic structure of living populations, and they pose questions about the genetic identity of vanished marine populations during the LGM. Economically, the approach may be used to understand how the ranges of exploited fish species may be displaced with the future climate warming.

Here, we investigate the stability of niches with benthic marine invertebrates along a Late Ordovician onshore-offshore gradient on the Cincinnati Arch in the eastern United States. Using a Gaussian niche model characterized by peak abundance, preferred environment, and environmental tolerance, with these parameters estimated through weighted averaging and logistic regression, we find evidence of strong niche conservatism in peak abundance and preferred environment, particularly for abundant taxa. This conservatism is maintained in successive depositional sequences and through the nearly 9-10 Myr study interval. Environmental tolerance shows no evidence of conservatism, although numerical simulations suggest that the error rates in estimates of this parameter are so high that they could overwhelm evidence of conservatism. These numerical simulations also indicate that both weighted averaging and logistic regression produce useful estimates of peak abundance and preferred environment, with slightly better results for weighted averaging. This evidence for niche conservatism suggests that long-term shifts of higher taxa of marine invertebrates into deeper water are primarily the result of differential rates of origination and extinction. These results also add to the evidence of long periods of relatively stable ecosystems despite regional environmental perturbations, and they constrain the causes of peaked patterns in occupancy. © 2011 The Paleontological Society.

Previous molecular-based studies of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), which is widespread across China and Japan, suggest that this species was able to persist in multiple refugia in this region. However, limited availability of samples precluded a detailed analysis of past distributions. By integrating ecological niche modelling with phylogenetic analyses, we aim to resolve the impact of past events on the population genetic structure of R. ferrumequinum and provide detailed descriptions of potential distribution patterns during this time. Location Central/East China and Japan. Methods Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using 1098bp of the mitochondrial ND2 gene and 13 microsatellite loci from bats sampled at 26 localities across China and Japan. Haplotype data were used in isolation-with-migration models (IMa) to estimate divergence dates between different lineages, and mismatch distribution analyses were undertaken to test for signs of population expansion. Geographical structuring of the microsatellite data was examined by spatial clustering. Ecological niche modelling was performed based on high-resolution palaeoclimate data inferred for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Results Phylogenetic analyses identified deep levels of divergence between three major lineages broadly corresponding to Central China, East China and Japan. The divergence of all three lineages was estimated to have occurred before the LGM. A strong correlation was observed between the ecological niche model and phylogenetic data, with both methods inferring that R. ferrumequinum populations in Central China did not undergo significant range contractions during glacial episodes. The impact of glacial cycles on East China would have been more severe, with some locations being unable to support viable populations. Zones of secondary contact were identified between Central/East China and East China/Japan, which probably result from some historical gene flow between isolated populations.

The fossiliferous Upper Laetolil Beds (ULB) (3.63–3.85 Ma) are unconformably overlain by the Upper Ndolanya Beds (UNB) (2.66 Ma). Both stratigraphic units contain a rich mammalian fauna, with ungulates predominating. Analysis of dental mesowear is applied to 23 ungulate taxa from both units, including Equidae, Bovidae and Giraffidae, and the results are compared to extant species. The equids at Laetoli represent the only specialized grazers throughout the succession. All Upper Laetolil Alcelaphini and Hippotragini have mesowear signatures that indicate intermediate feeding strategies, different from their modern counterparts that are mostly specialized grazers. This indicates a dietary shift in these lineages, a finding that is also supported by isotope studies. Mesowear data of ungulates from the ULB also suggest that extant ungulates representing closely related lineages in the same genus or even tribe may not serve as actualistic model taxa in faunal reconstructions using taxonomic uniformitarianism. The three species of giraffids and the remaining bovid taxa were either browsers or intermediate feeders, but not grazers. The almost complete absence of grazing guilds, and the heavy reliance on browse by most fossil herbivores, do not support the inference that the Laetoli environment was dominated by grassland. Within the Laetoli succession it appears that fundamental feeding niches converged over time, with grazers increasingly engaged in feeding on less abrasive components and intermediate-feeders closing the dietary gap by exploiting more abrasive feeding niches. Niche partitioning in the Laetoli ungulates appears to reflect environmental change and evolutionary trajectories in the major lineages. This distribution of feeding niches may serve as an overall indicator of niche diversity. Within the succession it appears that the diversity of feeding niches generally decreased. A decrease in feeding niches would suggest that the diverse habitat structure, which was typical of the ULB environment, no longer existed after the faunal and environmental transition that occurred after deposition of the ULB. After a hiatus of 1.0 million years, the UNB environment was more or less free of forest and woodland patches and can be characterized as more or less open grassland. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",Bovidae; Equidae; Giraffidae; Mesowear; Paleodiet; Paleoecology; Pliocene; Ruminantia; Tooth wear,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045101938,,FALSE,

The present contribution will focus on selected aspects of the world that predated the Neanderthals and their contemporaries. It draws mainly on data deriving from the meeting point of Africa and Eurasia (the Levantine Corridor) and focuses on the aspects that are most relevant for broadening our knowledge of the cultural background and evolution of the Neanderthals and early modern humans. In order to better understand Neanderthal material culture and associated behavior, the archaeological remains should be viewed in conjunction and perspective with insights from an earlier period, namely the Lower Paleolithic. The issues addressed here include the first appearances of particular technological inventions pertaining to Mousterian/Middle Paleolithic technologies, the abilities of humans to learn, accumulate and share knowledge of their environment and its exploitation modes, as well as mobility patterns, migrations and colonization events. Discoveries pertaining to Neanderthal populations in Europe have always been received with excitement and much scientific and lay interest. Over the years, many scholars have viewed these hominins as archaic and primitive creatures of limited abilities (and see discussion in Berman 1999; Speth 2004). Although recent opinion is subtler in its expression of this view of Neanderthal capabilities, the consensus on those of earlier hominins remains resolutely dismissive. Regrettably, this stance has resulted in the disregard of abundant data that suggest a strong correlation between ancient and modern behavioral patterns. The Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition (with emphasis on the European record) and the disappearance and ­replacement by modern humans of the Neanderthals have been topics of extensive research. In contrast, although the transition from the Lower Paleolithic to the Middle Paleolithic occurred at ca. 250–300 ka across the whole of the Old World (e.g., Clark 1982a, b, 1988; Mercier et al. 2007; Tryon and McBrearty 2002, 2006; Tryon et al. 2005; Jaubert 2000–2001:157; Moncel 1995, 2005; but see Beaumont and Vogel 2006), it has been rather succinctly addressed and far less thoroughly investigated. This analytical bias towards the earlier period is no doubt partly due to its less direct involvement with our own species, but also a reflection of the absence of long uninterrupted sequences, taphonomic disturbances at the sites, lack of suitable dating methods, and meager publication in respect of the later period discussed here. Yet despite all of the above, the available data indicate a continuity of hominin behavioral traits from the Lower to the Middle Paleolithic in diverse behavioral domains. Hominins of both periods share fundamental traits such as the ability to identify and occupy specific (favorable) landforms, the preference for specific ecological niches and habitats (e.g., Tuffreau et al. 1997; Roberts and Parfitt 1999; Pope 2002), successful exploitation of diverse resources and continuous survival in a given territory for a long period. Furthermore, hominin behavioral patterns that emerged during pre-Neanderthal times were later adopted, elaborated upon and widely distributed. These phenomena are evident in both the domains of planning and implementation. It will suffice to mention here the “domestication” and exploitation of fire (at Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov (GBY), Alperson-Afil and Goren-Inbar 2006; Alperson-Afil et al. 2007; the complex modes of raw material acquisition and its transportation (e.g., at ‘Ubeidiya, Bar-Yosef and Goren-Inbar 1993; at GBY, Madsen and Goren-Inbar 2004; at Tabun Cave, Verri et al. 2004, 2005); the emergence of species-specific targeting as a mode of game exploitation, indicating elaboration of hunting modes, weapons and efficient game processing (at Qesem Cave: Gopher et al. 2005; Lemorini et al. 2006 and at GBY: Rabinovich et al. 2008) and the presence, albeit rare, of non-utilitarian objects (a bead made of crinoid, GBY Goren-Inbar et al. 1991 and a figurine found at Berekhat Ram: Goren-Inbar 1986). Of great interest, due to its high archaeological visibility, is the realm of stone tool production. It is in this domain that particular aspects of the technologies characterizing the Neanderthal era are first observed in the Lower Paleolithic. Among these technologies are the Levallois flaking system, the soft hammer technique and the systematic production of blades. While all are widely represented in the Middle Paleolithic (MP) assemblages (and those of the Middle Stone Age [MSA]), and considered to some extent to be the hallmark of the MP, their origins are deeply rooted within the Lower Paleolithic and the Early Stone Age (ESA) material culture and technological sphere of knowledge. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",Lithic technology; Lower paleolithic; Middle paleolithic,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044834552,,FALSE,

The goal was to develop a high-resolution spatio-temporal framework for identifying and characterizing foraging patterns of mammalian herbivore lineages and fossil ostriches that could be used to investigate aspects of plant physiognomy and climate through the Laetoli succession. In general, dietary patterns at Laetoli suggest heterogeneous ecosystems with both C3 and C4 dietary plants available that could support grassland, woodland, and forested communities. All large-bodied mammalian herbivores analyzed yielded dietary signatures indicating mixed grazing/browsing strategies or exclusive reliance on C3 browse, more consistent with wooded than grassland-savanna biomes. Although there were no obvious uniform dietary shifts within specific mammalian herbivore groups in the sequence, the transition from the Upper Laetolil Beds to the Upper Ndolanya Beds documents a significant increase in the representation of grazing bovids. Relative to extant taxa in related lineages, the isotopic ranges of a number of Laetoli fossil herbivores are anomalous, indicating significantly more generalized intermediate C3/C4 feeding behaviors, perhaps indicative of dietary niches and habitat types with no close modern analogs. Diets of ostriches as reflected in the isotopic composition of eggshell components indicate predominantly C3 diets but with discrete isotopic shifts within the sequence linked to taxonomic and possibly environmental change. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",Enamel; Hominin; Isotopes; Ostrich eggshells; Paleodiet; Paleoecology; Pliocene; Tanzania,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989879865,,FALSE,

Many caves in the region contain evidence for Middle Paleolithic occupations. These find horizons are usually classified as belonging to the Swabian Mousterian. The find densities of lithic artifacts and anthropogenically modified fauna are typically low. Roughly 40 ka, the Upper Paleolithic began with the Aurignacian, which corresponds to the time of the arrival of modern humans in the region. At several key sites, Aurignacian find horizons overlie sterile geogenic deposits, and nowhere are Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic deposits interstratified. The material culture of the Aurignacian is characterized by numerous new forms of lithic and organic artifacts and much higher find densities than those usually documented in the Middle Paleolithic. While the resources used in both the Middle and Upper Paleolithic reflect a degree of continuity, the overall picture indicates that the start of the Upper Paleolithic represents a radical break in the history of settlement in southwestern Germany. With the arrival of modern humans in Eurasia, the cultural niche of Neanderthals was no longer viable.

The sea level along this part of the coast stood around 60-100 m below the present MSL during the last glacial maxima (around 20,000 YBP) and the rivers flowing at that time incised their valley to this base level. Later a humid climate with maximum representation of mangrove vegetation around 10,000 YBP was reported in this area, which suggested strengthened Asiatic Monsoon till the first part of Atlantic period. Initial subsidence and consequent flooding due to transgression, which had occurred 8000-6000 YBP, destroyed the mangrove vegetation giving rise to peaty soil. The pattern of rivers and geomorphological set up suggested that coastline was much towards east during the geological past and the rivers were flowing to the west and debouching in to the sea. The occurrences of peat sequence in the sediments in the low-lying area around the present Vembanad Lake and their radio carbon dating studies indicated their formation was from submerged coastal forest, especially mangrove vegetation. An event of regression (5000-3000 YBP) was occurred along Kerala coast during the late Holocene. Contemporaneous to this, one of the major backwater systems of the southwestern coast-the Vembanad Lake-was developed. The shell deposits of Kerala, which form a very rich source of carbonate, are formed by the accumulation of dead shell-bearing organisms and it is suggested that these organisms after being trapped in their ecological niche were destroyed due to marine regression. The present day backwaters and estuaries that occur behind the sandbars in Kerala thus possibly owe their origin to the regression during the past. Present study on the formation of palaeodeposit of sand in the Meenachil River basin lying along the southwest coast of India point towards the morphometric rearrangement and a multi-proxy analysis of the palaeodeposits could portray the Holocene geomorphological modifications of the southwestern coast. Sedimentological, geochemical, palynological and palaeobotanical analysis were done to evaluate the influence of palaeoclimatic factors on the modifications of the earth's surface configuration along this part of the Indian sub-continent and it is suggested that geomorphological modifications of the southwestern coast of India shall be classified into three categories (1) Pre-Vembanad Lake formation, (2) Contemporaneous to Lake formation and (3) Post-Lake formation. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The explanation for such disparity has often been attributed to the evolution of key innovations that facilitate colonization of new ecological niches. The factors underlying diversification in bees remain poorly explored. Bees are thought to have originated from apoid wasps during the Mid-Cretaceous, a period that coincides with the appearance of angiosperm eudicot pollen grains in the fossil record. The reliance of bees on angiosperm pollen and their fundamental role as angiosperm pollinators have contributed to the idea that both groups may have undergone simultaneous radiations. We demonstrate that one key innovation-the inclusion of foreign material in nest construction- underlies both a massive range expansion and a significant increase in the rate of diversification within the second largest bee family, Megachilidae. Basal clades within the family are restricted to deserts and exhibit plesiomorphic features rarely observed among modern bees, but prevalent among apoid wasps. Our results suggest that early bees inherited a suite of behavioural traits that acted as powerful evolutionary constraints. While the transition to pollen as a larval food source opened an enormous ecological niche for the early bees, the exploitation of this niche and the subsequent diversification of bees only became possible after bees had evolved adaptations to overcome these constraints. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Bee-flower relationships; Bees; Diversification; Key innovation; Megachilidae; Nesting biology,adaptation; bee; cladistics; colonization; Cretaceous; evolutionary biology; flower; fossil record; innovation; leaf; nesting behavior; range expansion; species diversity; wasp; Apoidea; Magnoliophyta; Megachilidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054904629,,FALSE,

Considering the dra006Datic impacts of the last glaciation in Europe, species might not have tracked climate changes through time and, as a consequence, their present-day ranges might be in disequilibrium with current climate. For 1016 European plant species, we assessed the relative importance of current climate and limited postglacial migration in determining species ranges using regression modelling and explanatory variables representing climate, and a novel species-specific hind-casting-based measure of accessibility to postglacial colonization. Climate was important for all species, while postglacial colonization also constrained the ranges of more than 50 per cent of the species. On average, climate explained five times more variation in species ranges than accessibility, but accessibility was the strongest determinant for one-sixth of the species. Accessibility was particularly important for species with limited long-distance dispersal ability, with southern glacial ranges, seed plants compared with ferns, and small-range species in southern Europe. In addition, accessibility explained one-third of the variation in species' disequilibrium with climate as measured by the realized/potential range size ratio computed with niche modelling. In conclusion, we show that although climate is the dominant broad-scale determinant of European plant species ranges, constrained dispersal plays an important supplementary role. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Disequilibrium; Ecological niche modelling; Hind-casting; Ice age refugia; Plant species distributions; Postglacial recolonization,climate effect; climate variation; disequilibrium; dispersal; ecological modeling; hindcasting; last glaciation; migration; niche; paleoclimate; paleoecology; Pleistocene; population distribution; Postglacial; recolonization; refugium; Europe; Filicophyta; Spermatophyta,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052951590,,TRUE,

Ceratopsians preferentially occur in mudstone, whereas hadrosaurs and the small ornithopod Thescelosaurus show a strong association with sandstone. By contrast, the giant carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex shows no preferred association with either lithology. These lithologies are used as an indicator of environment of deposition, with sandstone generally representing river environments, and finer grained sediments typically representing floodplain environments. Given these patterns of occurrence, we argue that spatial niche partitioning helped reduce competition for resources between the herbivorous dinosaurs. Within coastal lowlands ceratopsians preferred habitats farther away from rivers, whereas hadrosaurs and Thescelosaurus preferred habitats in close proximity to rivers, and T. rex, the ecosystem's sole large carnivore, inhabited both palaeoenvironments. Spatial partitioning of the environment helps explain how several species of large herbivorous dinosaurs coexisted. This study emphasizes that different lithologies can preserve dramatically dissimilar vertebrate assemblages, even when deposited in close proximity and within a narrow window of time.

We investigated patterns of diversification across 100 trees obtained from a new Bayesian inference of primate phylogeny that sampled trees in proportion to their posterior probabilities. First, we used simulations to assess the validity of previous studies that used linear models to investigate the links between IUCN Red List status and body mass. These analyses support the use of linear models for ordinal ranked data on threat status, and phylogenetic generalized linear models revealed a significant positive correlation between current extinction risk and body mass across our tree block. We then investigated historical patterns of speciation and extinction rates using a recently developed maximum-likelihood method. Specifically, we predicted that body mass correlates positively with extinction rate because larger bodied organisms reproduce more slowly, and body mass correlates negatively with speciation rate because smaller bodied organisms are better able to partition niche space. We failed to find evidence that extinction rates covary with body mass across primate phylogeny. Similarly, the speciation rate was generally unrelated to body mass, except in some tests that indicated an increase in the speciation rate with increasing body mass. Importantly, we discovered that our data violated a key assumption of sample randomness with respect to body mass.

However, critics have warned that CCS might lead to ""reinforced fossil fuel lock-in"", by perpetuating a fossil fuel based energy provision system. Due to large-scale investments in CCS infrastructure, the fossil fuel based 'regime' would be perpetuated to at least the end of this century. In this paper we investigate if and how CCS could help to avoid reinforcing fossil fuel lock-in. First we develop a set of criteria to estimate the degree of technological lock-in. We apply these criteria to assess the lock-in reinforcement effect of adding CCS to the fossil fuel socio-technical regime (FFR).In principle, carbon dioxide could be captured from any carbon dioxide point source. In the practice of present technological innovations, business strategies, and policy developments, CCS is most often coupled to coal power plants. However, there are many point sources of carbon dioxide that are not directly related to coal or even fossil fuels. For instance, many forms of bio-energy or biomass-based processes generate significant streams of carbon dioxide emissions. Capturing this carbon dioxide which was originally sequestered in biomass could lead to negative carbon dioxide emissions. We use the functional approach of technical innovations systems (TIS) to estimate in more detail the strengths of the ""niches"" CCS and Bio-Energy with CCS (BECCS). We also assess the orientation of the CCS niche towards the FFR and the risk of crowding out BECCS. Next we develop pathways for developing fossil energy carbon capture and storage, BECCS, and combinations of them, using transition pathways concepts. The outcome is that a large-scale BECCS development could be feasible under certain conditions, thus largely avoiding the risk of reinforced fossil fuel lock-in. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",BECCS; Biomass; Carbon capture and storage; Fossil fuel regime; Lock-in; Technical innovation system,bioenergy; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; energy planning; fossil fuel; innovation; point source; policy development,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956274223,,FALSE,

Although often considered a single event, the transition from traditional energy sources to fossil fuels involved numerous services and sectors at different times between 1500 and 1920. The main economic drivers identified for energy transitions were the opportunities to produce cheaper or better energy services. The existence of a niche market willing to pay more for these characteristics enabled new energy sources and technologies to be refined gradually until they could compete with the incumbent energy source. Nevertheless, this implied that, on average, the whole innovation chain took more than 100 years and the diffusion phase nearly 50 years. In the same way, low-carbon energy sources and technologies offer an additional characteristic (i.e. low carbon impact), which might be able to develop gradually in a niche market until they can compete with fossil fuels. However, because of consumers' tendency to free-ride, a successful transition will need governments to provide protection of this niche market-possibly for decades. Based on past experiences, a complete transition to a low carbon economy is likely to be very slow. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy transition; Low carbon economy; Technological innovation,Energy services; Energy source; Energy transitions; Low carbon; Low carbon economy; New energy sources; Niche markets; Single event; Technological innovation; Commerce; Fossil fuels; Technological forecasting; Innovation; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; fossil fuel; innovation; planning history,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957817677,,FALSE,

However, most studies to date have assessed these patterns only qualitatively, largely through visual observation of haplotype networks. Furthermore, many plant studies use only one or two individuals per locality, which probably limits the recovery of haplotype diversity. The aim of this study is to address the issues of sampling strategy and quantitative assessment of phylogeographical patterns in an eastern North American tree, Fagus grandifolia (American beech). Location: Eastern North America. Methods: Comparing two sampling strategies (more localities with lower sample size within localities versus fewer localities with increased sample size within localities), we analysed chloroplast DNA sequence data from more than 230 individuals across 130 localities using statistical parsimony, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. We then assessed support for inferred phylogenetic relationships using Monmonier's algorithm and analysis of molecular variance. As an additional test of biogeographic hypotheses, we employed ecological niche models (ENMs), which are used to predict the geographic range of a species from occurrence data and environmental records. Here we predict both present and palaeodistributions. Results: More haplotypes were recovered when more localities were sampled, but novel haplotypes and haplotype distributions were recovered using both strategies. Phylogeographical patterns suggest possible Pleistocene refugia along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts according to ENMs, as well as a more interior refugium according to Monmonier's algorithm. Main conclusions: Monmonier's algorithm supports previous findings of an interior refugium in the Lower Mississippi River Valley/Upper Midwest, while ENMs indicate that the Gulf and Atlantic coasts may have provided the most suitable habitat for F. grandifolia during the Pleistocene. Our findings allow us to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. We propose that future phylogeographical studies should follow a step-wise sampling strategy, balancing cost and expected outcomes. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Chloroplast DNA; Eastern North America; Ecological niche modelling; Fagus grandifolia; Monmonier's algorithm; Phylogeography; Pleistocene refugium,algorithm; Bayesian analysis; chloroplast; comparative study; dicotyledon; niche; paleobotany; paleoecology; phylogeography; Pleistocene; refugium; sampling; North America; Fagus; Fagus grandifolia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955604235,,TRUE,

The relationship between glacier area (S) and steady-state AAR of studied glaciers can be optimally described by a logarithmic regression equation.

Location: Oceanic and oceanic-like islands world-wide. Methods: Body size estimates of fossil insular carnivores and of their phylogenetically closest mainland relative were obtained from our own data and the published literature. Our dataset consisted of 18 species from nine islands world-wide. These data were used to test whether the body size of fossil insular carnivores varies as a function of body size of the mainland species in combination with characteristics of the island ecosystem. Results: Dwarfism was observed in two canid species. Moderate decrease in body mass was observed in one hyena species. Gigantism was observed in one otter species. Moderate body mass increase was observed in two otter species, one galictine mustelid and perhaps one canid. Negligible or no change in body mass at all was observed in five otter species, three galictine mustelids and one genet. Size changes in teeth do not lag behind in comparison to skeletal elements in the dwarfed canids. The evolutionary speed of dwarfism in a canid lineage is low. Main conclusions: Size change in fossil terrestrial insular carnivores was constrained by certain ecological conditions, especially the availability of prey of appropriate body size. When such alternative prey was not available, the carnivores retained their mainland size. The impact of competitive carnivores seems negligible. The case of (semi-)aquatic carnivores is much less clear. The species that maintained their ancestral body mass may have changed their diet, as is evidenced by their dentition. Among the otters, one case of significant size increase was observed, perhaps best explained as being due to it entering the niche of an obligate aquatic otter. Dwarfism was not observed in otters. The island rule seems to apply to fossil carnivores, but with exceptions.

These two systems have been simulated at several Indian locations. The preliminary results indicate that the use of CSP technologies in India make financial sense for the north-western part of the country (particularly in Rajasthan and Gujarat states). Moreover, internalization of secondary benefits of carbon trading under clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol further improves the financial feasibility of CSP systems at other locations considered in this study. It may be noted that the locations blessed with annual direct solar radiation more than 1800kWh/m2 are best recommended for installation of CSP systems. The results obtained can be used as preliminary indicators for identifying niche areas for immediate/short-term utilization of solar energy for concentrating solar power generation in India. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Concentrating solar power; Solar thermal power generation; Techno-economic evaluation,1000 MW; Action plan; Carbon trading; Clean Development Mechanism; Concentrating solar power; CSP technology; Direct solar radiation; Economic assessments; Energy options; Government of India; Indian locations; Installed capacity; KYOTO protocol; Lighting systems; Manufacturing capability; Market leadership; Niche areas; Off-grids; Parabolic trough collectors; Policy framework; Rajasthan; Solar power; Solar thermal; Solar thermal collector; Solar thermal power generation; Techno-economic evaluation; Techno-economic feasibility; Tower technology; Climate change; Computer operating procedures; Emission control; Rural areas; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Solar radiation; Sun; Technology; Solar energy; clean development mechanism; emissions trading; energy policy; Kyoto Protocol; policy implementation; power generation; solar power; solar radiation; thermal power; India,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950929117,,FALSE,

The concentration of phosphate took place by repeated alternations of low sedimentation rates and condensation (hardgrounds), in situ early-diagenetic precipitation of fluorapatite, winnowing and polyphase reworking of previously phosphatized skeletons and hardground-derived clasts. The succession of repeated cycles of sedimentation, phosphate concentration, and reworking led to multi-event phosphate deposits rich in allochthonous particles. Phosphogenesis was primarily mediated by microbial activity, which is evidenced by the abundance of phosphatized putative microbial remains. These occur as smooth and segmented filaments, sheaths, and ovoid-shaped coccoids. These simple morphologies commonly form composite frameworks as a result of their aggregation and entanglement, leading to the record of biofilms, microbial mats, and complex networks. These infested the calcitic skeletonized microfossils that littered the substrate. Microbial activity evidences epilithic (anisotropic coatings on skeletons), euendolithic (perforating skeletal walls), and cryptoendolithic (lining inter- and intraparticulate pores) strategies, the latter dominated by bundles of filaments and globular clusters that grew along the cavities of helcionellids and hyoliths. According to their epilithic versus cryptic strategies, microbial populations that penetrated and dwelled inside hard skeletal substrates show different network and colonial morphologies. These early Cambrian shell concentrations were the loci of a stepwise colonization made by saprophytic to mutualistic, cyanobacterial-fungal consortia. Their euendolithic and cryptoendolithic ecological niches provided microbial refugia to manage the grazing impact mainly led by metazoans. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"mineral; phosphate; Cambrian; colonization; continental shelf; growth rate; limestone; metazoan; microbial activity; microfossil; micromorphology; phosphogenesis; sedimentation; ultrastructure; article; biofilm; cyanobacterium; fossil; France; fungus; green alga; growth, development and aging; microbiology; paleontology; phosphorite; red alga; scanning electron microscopy; sediment; ultrastructure; Algae, Green; Algae, Red; Biofilms; Cyanobacteria; Fossils; France; Fungi; Geologic Sediments; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Minerals; Paleontology; Phosphates; France; Montagne Noire; Coccoidea; Cyanobacteria; Helcionellida; Metazoa",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-76549128939,,FALSE,

The shells of this species have been found to commonly serve as a basibiont host. Epibionts comprise the coeval brachiopod Longtancunella chengjiangensis and the cone-shaped cnidarian-related Archotuba conoidalis, as well as rounded smaller-sized epizoans (lesser than 2 mm). A principle morphological analysis demonstrates that the ovoid and rounded organisms that often occur along the commissure of D. pista resemble small juvenile or immature brachiopods. Epibiont-bearing shells of D. pista with soft-tissue preservation demonstrate that the host brachiopods were overgrown while alive, and provide an argument for D. pista having a semiinfaunal life style with only the slim pedicle embedded in sediment.

An important part of the answer may be biodiversity itself. As new species form they may often create new niches, providing an impetus for other organisms to adapt and speciate. This hypothesis of 'cascading' or 'sequential' speciation has been argued to be particularly relevant for host-plant-specific phytophagous insects and their associated parasites. Here, we discuss the empirical and theoretical bases for sequential speciation and its potential significance for understanding the genesis of new life forms. We examine the application of the concept that biodiversity begets biodiversity by palaeontologists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists to explain current and past distributions of organisms. We look at factors that may promote and restrict sequential speciation and review evidence from phytophagous insects for the process in nature.

Here, we used a phylogenomic approach to construct a well-resolved 'core' cyanobacterial tree. The branching positions of four lineages (Thermosynechococcus elongatus, Synechococcus elongatus, Synechococcus PCC 7335 and Acaryochloris marina) were problematic, probably due to long branch attraction artifacts. A consensus genomic tree was used to study trait evolution using ancestral state reconstruction (ASR). The early cyanobacteria were probably unicellular, freshwater, had small cell diameters, and lacked the traits to form thick microbial mats. Relaxed molecular clock analyses suggested that early cyanobacterial lineages were restricted to freshwater ecosystems until at least 2.4 Ga, before diversifying into coastal brackish and marine environments. The resultant increases in niche space and nutrient availability, and consequent sedimentation of organic carbon into the deep oceans, would have generated large pulses of oxygen into the biosphere, possibly explaining why oxygen rose so rapidly. Rapid atmospheric oxidation could have destroyed the methane-driven greenhouse with simultaneous drawdown in pCO2, precipitating 'Snowball Earth' conditions. The traits associated with the formation of thick, laminated microbial mats (large cell diameters, filamentous growth, sheaths, motility and nitrogen fixation) were not seen until after diversification of the LPP, SPM and PNT clades, after 2.32 Ga. The appearance of these traits overlaps with a global carbon isotopic excursion between 2.2 and 2.1 Ga. Thus, a massive re-ordering of biogeochemical cycles caused by the appearance of complex laminated microbial communities in marine environments may have caused this excursion. Finally, we show that ASR may provide an explanation for why cyanobacterial microfossils have not been observed until after 2.0 Ga, and make suggestions for how future paleobiological searches for early cyanobacteria might proceed. In summary, key evolutionary events in the microbial world may have triggered some of the key geologic upheavals on the Paleoproterozoic Earth. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"oxygen; biogeochemical cycle; biosphere; carbon isotope; cyanobacterium; evolutionary biology; freshwater ecosystem; genomics; greenhouse gas; marine ecosystem; microbial community; microfossil; niche breadth; nutrient availability; organic carbon; origin of life; oxygen; paleobiology; sedimentation; article; atmosphere; chemistry; classification; cyanobacterium; ecology; evolution; growth, development and aging; phylogeny; Atmosphere; Cyanobacteria; Ecology; Evolution; Oxygen; Phylogeny; Acaryochloris marina; Cyanobacteria; Synechococcus; Synechococcus elongatus; Synechococcus sp.

This fact does not necessarily apply to second-generation biofuels or small-scale niche productions. Straight vegetable oil (SVO) can be used directly in diesel engines with minor modifications.

The extent of these declines from forested areas of south-eastern Australia, however, remains poorly understood. In this paper we use sub-fossil deposits of the sooty owl (Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa) as a tool for understanding the diversity of the small mammal palaeocommunity. These results are compared to the contemporary sooty owl diet from the same geographical region to investigate the degree of small mammal decline following European settlement. Of 28 mammal species detected in sub-fossil deposits and considered prey items of the sooty owl at the time of European settlement, only 10 species were detected in the contemporary sooty owl diet. Numerous small mammal species have not only recently suffered severe declines in distribution and abundance but have also recently undergone niche contraction, as they occupied a greater diversity of regions and habitats at the time of European settlement. For some species our understanding of their true ecological niche and ecological potential is therefore limited. The species that underwent the greatest declines occupied open habitat types or were terrestrial. The severity of decline is also likely to have resulted in severe disruption of ecosystem functions, with wide scale ecosystem consequences. There is an urgent need to improve small mammal conservation, to maintain crucial ecosystem functions performed by small mammals.

What are the consequences of changing climate for the tree genus Polylepis? Location: High central tropical Andes. Methods: We characterized the ecological baseline conditions for Polylepis woodlands over the last ca. 370 000 years through: (i) examination of fossil pollen records (Salar de Uyuni and Lake Titicaca) and (ii) a review of autecological information concerning Polylepis. Results: Fossil pollen data revealed fluctuations in the abundance (ca. 0-34%) of Polylepis pollen before the arrival of humans in South America (412 000 years ago), indicating that Polylepis did not form permanent continuous woodland before the arrival of humans and that climatic factors can drive rapid vegetation change. Autecological assessment of Polylepis revealed: (i) negative moisture balance, (ii) fire, (iii) waterlogging, and (iv) cloud cover to be critical in determining the niche space available for Polylepis. Conclusions: Polylepis niche space in the central Andes was at a maximum during warm and wet conditions in the past, but might be at a minimum during the warmer and drier than modern conditions predicted for later this century. The sensitivity to past global climate change emphasizes the need for conservation planners to consider model predictions of a warmer central Andes in the coming decades when developing planting schemes.

This article discusses reasons for the outstanding vascular plant diversity using a hierarchical scale-oriented top-down approach (Grüninger 2005), from the global scale to the local microscale. The global scale explains general (paleo-) ecological factors valid for most parts of the humid tropics, addressing various hypotheses and theories, such as the ""greater effective evolutionary time"", constant input of ""accidentals"", the ""seasonal variability hypothesis"", the ""intermediate disturbance hypothesis"", and the impact of soil fertility. The macroscale focuses on the Andes in northwestern South America. The tropical Andes are characterised by many taxa of restricted range which is particularly true for the Amotape-Huancabamba region, i.e. the so called Andean Depression, which is effective as discrete phytogeographic transition as well as barrier zone. Interdigitation of northern and southern flora elements, habitat fragmentation, geological and landscape history, and a high speciation rate due to rapid genetic radiation of some taxa contribute to a high degree of diversification. The mesoscale deals with the special environmental features of the eastern mountain range, the Cordillera Real and surrounding areas in southern Ecuador. Various climatic characteristics, the orographic heterogeneity, the geologic and edaphic conditions as well as human impact are the most prominent factors augmenting plant species diversity. On microscale, prevailing regimes of disturbance and environmental stresses, the orographic basement, as well as the general role on the various mountain chains are considered. Here, micro-habitats e.g. niches for epiphytes, effects of micro-relief patterns, and successions after small-sized disturbance events are screened. Direct effects of human impact are addressed and a perspective of possible effects of climate change on plant diversity is presented. © 2009 IALE-D.",Andean depression; Disturbance ecology; Scale dependent approach; Tropical mountain forests; Vascular plant diversity,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949395306,,FALSE,

Here we use ecological niche modeling (ENM), specifically the GARP (Genetic Algorithm using Rule-set Prediction) modeling system, to reconstruct the geographic distribution of individual species during two time slices from the middle Miocene through early Pliocene. This method combines known species occurrence points with environmental parameters inferred from sedimentological variables to model each species' fundamental niche. The geographic range of each species is then predicted to occupy the geographic area within the study region wherever the set of environmental parameters that constrain the fundamental niche occurs. We analyze changes in the predicted distributions of individual species between time slices in relation to Miocene/Pliocene climate change. Specifically, we examine and compare distribution patterns for two time slices that span the period from the mid-Miocene (Barstovian) Climatic Optimum into the early Pliocene (Blancan) to determine whether habitat fragmentation led to speciation within the clade and whether species survival was related to geographic range size. Patchy geographic distributions were more common in the middle Miocene when speciation rates were high. During the late Miocene, when speciation rates were lower, continuous geographic ranges were more common. Equid species tracked their preferred habitat within the Great Plains region as well as regionally throughout North America. Species with larger predicted ranges preferentially survived the initial cooling event better than species with small geographic ranges. As climate continued to deteriorate in the late Miocene, however, range size became irrelevant to survival, and extinction rates increased for species of all range sizes. This is the first use of ENM and GARP in the continental fossil record. This powerful quantitative biogeographic method offers great promise for studies of other taxa and geologic intervals. © 2009 The Paleontological Society.

Unresolved questions include the magnitude and direction of temperature seasonality (i.e. were these climates more or less seasonal than present) and the temporal changes in precipitation. Central to the no-analogue problem is the truncation of modern pollen-climate relationships for abundant late-glacial taxa such as Fraxinus. Here we present a new method called the expanded response-surface (ERS) method, developed to reconstruct climates from no-analogue pollen assemblages and applied to a high-resolution late-glacial pollen record from Crystal Lake, Illinois to test hypotheses about late-glacial climates. The key assumptions central to the ERS method are: (1) plant species and pollen abundances follow symmetrical unimodal distributions along climatic gradients, (2) taxa with truncated distributions in modern climate space occupy a subset of their fundamental niche, and (3) expansion of truncated distributions by mirroring around the distributional mode recovers the portion of the fundamental niche not realized in the modern climate space. With the ERS method, we expanded modern pollen-climate relationships by mirroring pollen abundances for each taxon around a mode defined with respect to four climate axes (mean winter temperature, mean summer temperature, mean winter precipitation, and mean summer precipitation). The ERS method reconstructed past temperatures and precipitation during the height of no-analogue conditions (14 160-12 370 cal yr BP) for 37% of the Crystal Lake samples where techniques that employed only modern observational data found matches for only 13% of the fossil samples. The total climate space of the expanded taxa set allowed analogue matches under more seasonal-than-present climates with higher-than-present precipitation. The ERS climate reconstructions for the height of no-analogue conditions indicated cooler-than-present summer and winter temperatures, similar-to-present seasonal range in temperatures, higher-than-present winter precipitation, and similar-to-present summer precipitation. These results thus suggest that high moisture availability helped drive the formation of the Midwestern no-analogue communities with high Fraxinus nigra abundances, but do not show higher-than-present temperature seasonality notwithstanding the higher-than-present insolation seasonality at this time. During the no-analogue late-glacial interval, Picea mariana, F. nigra, and Larix stands probably grew on low-lying, poorly drained soils in the Crystal Lake region; whereas Abies, Picea glauca, Quercus, and Ostrya/Carpinus grew on upland positions with better soil drainage. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sea-level lowering of &gt;100 m produced a regional unconformity (type 1), represented by palaeosols and incised valley. C4 vegetation expanded on exposed lowstand surface in an ambient dry glacial climate. At ∼9 ka transgression inundated the lowstand surface pushing the coastline and mangrove front ∼100 km inland. Simultaneous intensification of monsoon and very high sediment discharge (∼4-8 times than modern) caused a rapid aggradation of both floodplain and estuarine valley fill deposits between 8 and 7 ka. The Hoogli River remaining along its present drainage possibly acted as the main conduit for transgression and sediment discharge that was subsequently abandoned. C3 vegetation dominated the delta plain during this time. From 7 ka onward progradation of delta plain started and continued till recent. This period experienced a mixed C3-C4 vegetation with localized mangroves in the mid-Holocene to dominant return of C4 vegetation in the late Holocene period. The study indicates that while the initiation of western part of GB delta occurred at least 1 ka earlier than the global mean delta formation age, the progradation started at ∼7 ka, at least 2 ka earlier than thought before.

We compared populations of three common and three rare European tree species in the distribution centre and at the eastern margin with respect to abundance, niche breadth, and preferential occurrence along several soil-related niche axes. We hypothesised: (i) that abundance is higher, and niche breadth greater, in the distribution centre than at the margin, (ii) that the occupied niche differs between central and marginal populations with species being restricted to more favourable soils at the margin, and (iii) that common and rare species show different patterns. We characterised the occupied niche and niche breadth in a semi-quantitative way and discuss the role of human impact on tree abundance in the light of evidence from paleoecology and forest dynamics research. Five of the six species are more abundant in the centre than at the margin, at least in the natural vegetation prior to human intervention. In contrast to soil niche breadth, the preference for soil chemical and hydrological properties differed between centre and margin. Contrary to expectation, a shift to less fertile and partly also drier sites at the margin was observed, although bedrocks which give rise to the development of fertile soils were more frequent in Slovakia (ca. 49% of the total area compared to 20% in Central Germany) and bedrock types which produce infertile soils were more abundant in Central Germany (about 23% vs. 2% in Slovakia). While the abundant-centre-distribution hypothesis is supported by our data, we found no conclusive evidence of competitive displacement of weaker competitors and of a niche shift of superior competitors to more favourable sites at the range margin. Factors other than competition must be responsible for the observed niche shifts.

Location: The Cape and Drakensberg regions of southern Africa. Methods: Bioclimatic data were used to estimate habitat amount and habitat heterogeneity in the Cape and Drakensberg regions; these data were then used to explain the patterns of species diversity in the Pentaschistis clade (Poaceae) in these two regions. Habitat variables were used to create 'bioclimatic units' to characterize 1′ × 1′ cells in southern Africa and to describe the niches of species. Using these bioclimatic units, the niche and range sizes of species in the two regions were compared. A phylogram was used to test for age and lineage effects. Results: Pentaschistis species diversity and turnover are higher in the Cape than the Drakensberg. There is no significant difference in the habitat amount and heterogeneity between the two regions. Species occupy the same range of estimated niche sizes, yet there are significantly more range-restricted Pentaschistis species in the Cape. Main conclusions: The roles of age- and lineage-related effects are rejected; biodiversity differences lie in the regions. Current macrohabitat does not explain the differences in biodiversity between the two regions. The larger number of range-restricted species in the Cape cannot be explained by dispersal mechanism or the occupation of range-restricted habitats. Species of Pentaschistis and other Cape clades share characteristics associated with species from historically climatically stable areas, and palaeoclimatic and palaeontological evidence indicates the Cape climate has been more stable than the Drakensberg climate throughout the Pleistocene. We conclude that the corresponding lack of extinction might have allowed an accumulation of species in the Cape. Similar climatic and biological evidence for the south-west Australian Floristic and Mediterranean regions indicate that the same mechanism might explain the high species richness of these mediterranean regions. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biodiversity; Biogeography; Cape flora; Extinction; Macroecology; Mediterranean; Palaeoclimate; Southern Africa,biodiversity; biogeography; extinction; grass; habitat structure; macroecology; Mediterranean environment; paleoclimate; species diversity; species richness; Africa; Drakensberg; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Pentaschistis; Poaceae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-68549133474,,FALSE,?

CEMs are used to examine veiled evolutionary questions about extinctions, locations of past refugia and migration pathways, or to propose hypotheses concerning the past population structure of species in phylogeographical studies. CEMs are sensitive to theoretical assumptions, to model classes and to projections in non-analogous climates, among other issues. Studies hindcasting the climatic niches of species often make reference to these limitations. However, to obtain strong scientific inferences, we must not only be aware of these potential limitations but we must also overcome them. Here, I review the literature on hindcasting CEMs. I discuss the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling, i.e. the stability of climatic niches through time and the equilibrium of species with climate. I also summarize a set of 'recommended practices' to improve hindcasting. The studies reviewed: (1) rarely test the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling such as the stability of species climatic niches through time and the equilibrium of species with climate; (2) they only use one model class (72% of the studies) and one palaeoclimatic reconstruction (62.5%) to calibrate their models; (3) they do not check for the occurrence of non-analogous climates (97%); and (4) they do not use independent data to validate the models (72%). Ignoring the theoretical assumptions behind niche modelling and using inadequate methods for hindcasting CEMs may well entail a cascade of errors and naïve ecological and evolutionary inferences. We should also push integrative research lines linking macroecology, physiology, population biology, palaeontology, evolutionary biology and CEMs for a better understanding of niche dynamics across space and time. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Climate envelope models; Forecasting; Fossil record; Hindcasting; Niche dynamics; Physiological limits; Population processes,climate change; extinction; fossil record; literature review; modeling; niche; phylogeography; physiology; population structure; prediction; spatial distribution,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-68549125409,,FALSE,*

Based on an integrated approach using a mitochondrial DNA phylogeny and a trait-specific molecular clock in combination with insights from the fossil record and palaeoenvironmental data, we demonstrate that the accumulation of extant molecular diversity in the endemic group did not start before approximately 600 000 years ago from a single lineage.

We argue that severe drops in the lake level of Lake Malawi in the Pleistocene offer a potential explanation for this pattern.

This work reveals that desertification started in the southwest ca 17-16 Ma, much earlier than the region of the present-day Sahara (ca 8-7 Ma) and long before the deserts in East Africa (Plio-Pleistocene). A consequence of this history is that animals and plants inhabiting the South of the continent had a long period of time in which to adapt to arid, unstable climatic conditions. When parts of East Africa became arid during the Late Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene, several of these lineages expanded northwards and occupied developing arid niches before local lineages could adapt. Several of the latter became extinct, while others withdrew westwards as the tropical forest diminished in extent.

New lines of evidence come from the functional morphology of its powerful prehensile frontal appendages that, combined with large spherical eyes, are thought to have played a key role in the recognition and capture of swimming or epibenthic prey. The swimming and steering of this arthropod was achieved by the beating of multiple setose exopods and a flap-like telson. The appendage morphology of Isoxys indicates possible phylogenetical relationships with the megacheirans, a widespread group of assumed predator arthropods characterized by a pre-oral 'great appendage'. Evidence from functional morphology and taphonomy suggests that Isoxys was able to migrate through the water column and was possibly exploiting hyperbenthic niches for food. Although certainly not unique, the case of Isoxys supports the idea that off-bottom animal interactions such as predation, associated with complex feeding strategies and behaviours (e.g. vertical migration and hunting) were established by the Early Cambrian.

Here we infer the historical range shifts of Laurus, a paradigmatic tree of the Tethyan flora that has covered southern Eurasia since the Oligo-Miocene, by means of phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses. Location Mediterranean Basin, Black Sea and Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands). Methods We analysed plastid DNA (cpDNA) sequence (trnK-matK, trnD-trnT) variation in 57 populations of Laurus and three Lauraceae genera. Phylogenetic methods (maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference) and statistical parsimony networks were used to reconstruct relationships among haplotypes. These results were contrasted with the fossil record and bioclimatic niche-based model predictions of past distributions to infer the migration routes and location of refugia. Results The phylogenetic tree revealed monophyly for Laurus. Overall sequence variability was low within Laurus, but six different haplotypes were distinguished and a single network retrieved, portraying three lineages primarily related to geography. A strongly divergent eastern lineage occupied Turkey and the Near East, a second clade was located in the Aegean region and, lastly, a western clade grouped all Macaronesian and central and western Mediterranean populations. A close relationship was observed between the Macaronesian populations of L. azorica and the western populations of L. nobilis. Main conclusions The phylogeographical structure of Laurus preserves the imprints of an ancient contraction and break-up of the range that resulted in the evolution of separate cpDNA lineages in its western- and easternmost extremes. Intense range dynamics in the western Mediterranean and multiple glacial refugia contributed to the generation and long-term conservation of this phylogeographical pattern, as shown by the fit between the haplotype ranges and past suitable areas inferred from bioclimatic models.

Main conclusions No significant effect on diversification rate was found regarding the establishment of a Mediterranean-type climate, or the onset of the Quaternary climatic oscillations. Rather, the accelerated rate of speciation in the N. arvensis complex is plausibly related to increased opportunities for allopatric speciation afforded by the (palaeo)geographical complexity of the Aegean archipelago combined with Late Pleistocene changes in climate and sea level.

(1) In California, recent analyses demonstrate that the diversity of species derived from different biogeographical origins is significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation gradients. These patterns support the hypothesis that niche conservatism is an important factor structuring modern diversity gradients. However, depending on how far back in time one looks, a species may be assigned to different origins; future discussions of biogeographical origins need to address the appropriate time frame for analysis. (2) Past research has demonstrated distinctive trait syndromes among woody plants of the Mediterranean, Chile, California and Mexico, and proposed that the syndromes are associated with lineages of different age in these floras. Reanalysis of individual traits demonstrates greater variability among regions than previously reported. The classification of plants into 'old' and 'new' genera is re-evaluated, and it is suggested that greater attention be paid to the age of traits, rather than to the age of taxa, especially at an arbitrary rank such as genus. (3) The idea of mediterranean-climate regions as 'climatic islands' is examined. Space-time diagrams of climate enable one to view the emergence of distinctive climatic regions in a continental context. The terms 'synclimatic' and 'anticlimatic' are proposed, referring to migration routes that parallel climate contours in space and time versus those that cross contours (including the case of geographic stasis in the face of climate change), respectively. Mediterranean-climate regions have served as important case studies in plant ecology and evolution, and merit continued close examination in the light of continued advances in phylogenetics and palaeoecology. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Adaptive evolution; Biogeographical origins; Biotic assembly; Climate change; Diversity; Environmental island; Mediterranean-type ecosystem; Migration; Niche conservatism; Trait syndromes,adaptive radiation; climate change; flora; geographical variation; Mediterranean environment; niche; paleoecology; phylogenetics; phytogeography; precipitation (climatology); species diversity; temperature gradient; woody plant; California; Mediterranean Sea; North America; United States,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649207436,,FALSE,

Its spread is the most recent and best constrained invasion of a main tree species in northern Europe and allows an assessment of colonization patterns and associated competitive replacement processes. 2. We analysed ?ve selected high-resolution pollen accumulation rate (PAR) -records along a 700-km long transect in the direction of P. abies invasion from eastern Finland to central Sweden across the present P. abies- and Pinus sylvestris-dominated southern boreal zone. 3. Our results show that the P. abies population increased in size from the time of the initial expansion to levels comparable with the modern in 100 550 years. At each site P. abies invaded a dense, intact Pinus Betula Alnus forest, mixed with temperate deciduous taxa, particularly Tilia cordata and Corylus avellana. The resident mixed forest provided no or weak resistance to the colonization of P. abies, and the variable population growth rate was therefore not caused by compositional differences in the resident forest but by other, possibly local edaphic factors. 4. Of the taxa that formed the resident forest, T. cordata responded most strongly to the invasion of P. abies. This suggests that the mid-Holocene T. cordata population decline was not directly climate- induced but resulted from competitive replacement due to overlapping ecological niches with P. abies, a stronger competitor. 5. Synthesis. The rise to dominance of P. abies was caused not only by its rapid population growth but by associated competitive suppression of other taxa, leading to a major ecosystem change from a mixed conifer-deciduous forest to the modern P. abies- and P. sylvestris-dominated boreal conifer forest in central Fennoscandia. This competitive suppression by P. abies is still re?ected in the scattered occurrence and generally weak performance of T. cordata in the boreal zone of Europe and may in?uence its distribution and abundance patterns under predicted future climate scenarios. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Boreal ecosystem; Competitive interactions; Holocene; Invasion; Palaeoecology; Picea abies; Pollen accumulation rates; Tilia cordata,biological invasion; boreal forest; colonization; coniferous tree; deciduous forest; Holocene; invasive species; paleoecology; pollen; Eurasia; Europe; Fennoscandia; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Abies; Alnus; Betula; Coniferophyta; Corylus; Corylus avellana; Malvaceae; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Tilia cordata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-67449149013,,FALSE,

For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and Adélie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Adaptation; Climate change; Dispersal; Ecosystem change; ENSO; Penguins; Phenology; SAM; Southern Ocean,climate change; dispersal; ecosystem dynamics; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; geographical distribution; life history trait; local adaptation; niche; paleoecology; phenology; seabird; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Southern Ocean; Pygoscelis adeliae; Spheniscidae,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-66749179915,,FALSE,

However, if topographic niches such as shading or windblown-snow augmented mass-balance then ELAs cannot reflect regional climate and determining the significance of these topoclimates is therefore important. The Brecon Beacons, South Wales, contains upland glacial landforms dating to the Younger Dryas (11,000-10,000 yr BP) when local climate was at the threshold for glaciation. This case study categorises topoclimate using three-dimensional modelling of topography and reconstructed palaeoglaciers from two sites containing mapped moraines whose orientation suggest complex patterns of deglaciation. Ablation season solar radiation is modelled over multiple ice-surfaces as shade from surrounding topography and intensity from ice-surface incidence angle. Snowblow and avalanching potential models are also used and the significance of all topoclimate variables assessed against a mass-balance deficit calculated for each glacier given palaeoclimate models for the region. Results demonstrate that both glaciers were likely to be heavily reliant on topoclimate and that previous studies underestimate the significance of solar radiation. Modelled over multiple ice-surfaces reflecting patterns of recession, results indicate that the distribution of topoclimate variables predicts the style of deglaciation at both sites, possibly explaining the complexity of glacial evidence in this environment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent research at Ortvale Klde has documented the hunting of prime-age adult Capra caucasica and the organization of hunting activities according to this species' migratory behaviors, which made them locally abundant on a seasonal basis. Our analyses suggest that Neanderthals and modern humans occupied the same ecological niche and were equally capable of learning and exploiting key biogeographic information pertaining to the feeding, mating, migratory, and flight behaviors of this species. In these respects there appear to have been few alterations in medium/large game hunting practices between the Late Middle Palaeolithic and Early Upper Palaeolithic, with ungulate species abundance in the entire stratigraphic sequence of Ortvale Klde reflecting seasonal fluctuations in food supply rather than specialization, differences in diet breadth, hunting ability, or technology. Attention is paid to faunal data from neighboring sites to test whether patterns identified at Ortvale Klde are in any way representative of larger regional subsistence behaviors. We find that such patterns are only replicable at sites that have experienced similar zooarchaeological and taphonomic study. We conclude that Neanderthal and modern human populations occupied and exploited the same ecological niches, at least seasonally, and that the regional archaeological record documents a clear spatial and temporal disruption in Neanderthal settlement resulting from failed competition with expanding modern human groups.

It is based on the BIOME4 vegetation model and uses both vegetation δ13C and biome as constraints. Previous inverse models based on only one of the two proxies were already improvements over standard reconstruction methods such as the modern analog since these did not take into account some external forcings, for example CO2 concentration. This new approach makes it possible to describe a potential ""isotopic niche"" defined by analogy with the ""climatic niche"" theory. Boreal and temperate biomes simulated by BIOME4 are considered in this study. We demonstrate the impact of CO2 concentration on biome existence domains by replacing a ""most likely biome"" with another with increased CO2 concentration. Additionally, the climate imprint on δ13C between and within biomes is shown: the colder the biome, the lighter its potential isotopic niche; and the higher the precipitation, the lighter the δ13C. For paleoclimate purposes, previous inverse models based on either biome or δ13C did not allow informative paleoclimatic reconstructions of both precipitation and temperature. Application of the new approach to the Eemian of La Grande Pile palynological and geochemical records reduces the range in precipitation values by more than 50% reduces the range in temperatures by about 15% compared to previous inverse modeling approaches.

They became extinct during the latest Cretaceous (latest Maastrichtian), at, or near, the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, following an apparent decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous. This reduction in species richness has been linked to the ecological radiation of birds in the Early Cretaceous and the proposal that birds competitively excluded pterosaurs from many key niches. However, although competition is often posited as a causal mechanism for many of the clade-clade replacements observed in the fossil record, these hypotheses are rarely tested. Here we present a detailed examination of pterosaur diversity through time, including both taxic and phylogenetically corrected diversity estimates and comparison of these estimates with a model describing temporal variation in the number of pterosaur-bearing formations (a proxy for rock availability). Both taxic and phylogenetic diversity curves are strongly correlated with numbers of pterosaur-bearing formations, suggesting that a significant part of the signal contained within pterosaur diversity patterns may be controlled by geological and taphonomic megabiases rather than macroevolutionary processes. There is no evidence for a long-term decline in pterosaur diversity through the Cretaceous, although a reduction in morphological, ecological, and phylogenetic diversity does appear to have occurred in the latest Cretaceous.

We use nine data sets from modern, relatively undisturbed coastal study areas to evaluate how the response of living molluscan assemblages to environmental gradients (water depth and seafloor type; ""environmental component"" of a gradient) and geographic separation (""spatial component"") is captured by their death assemblages. We find that: 1. Living assemblages vary in composition either in response to environmental gradients alone (consistent with a species-sorting model) or in response to a combination of environmental and spatial gradients (mass-effect model). None of the living assemblages support the neutral model (or the patch-dynamic model), in which variation in species abundance is related to the spatial configuration of stations alone. These findings also support assumptions that mollusk species consistently differ in responses to environmental gradients, and suggest that in the absence of postmortem bias, environmental gradients might be accurately captured by variation in species composition among death assemblages. Death assemblages do in fact respond uniquely to environmental gradients, and show a stronger response when abundances are square-root transformed to downplay the impact of numerically abundant species and increase the effect of rare species. 2. Species' niche positions (position of maximum abundance) along bathymetric and sedimentary gradients in death assemblages show significantly positive rank correlations to species positions in living assemblages in seven of nine data sets (both square-root-transformed and presence-absence data). 3. The proportion of compositional variation explained by environmental gradients in death assemblages is similar to that of counterpart living assemblages. Death assemblages thus show the same ability to capture environmental gradients as do living assemblages. In some instances compositional dissimilarities in death assemblages show higher rank correlation with spatial distances than with environmental gradients, but spatial structure in community composition is mainly driven by spatially structured environmental gradients. 4. Death assemblages correctly identify the dominance of niche metacommunity models in mollusk communities, as revealed by counterpart living assemblages. This analysis of the environmental resolution of death assemblages thus supports fine-scale niche and paleoenvironmental analyses using molluscan fossil records. In spite of taphonomic processes and time-averaging effects that modify community composition, death assemblages largely capture the response of living communities to environmental gradients, partly because of redundancy in community structure that is inherently associated with multispecies assemblages. The molluscan data sets show some degree of redundancy as evidenced by the presence of at least two mutually exclusive subsets of species that replicate the community structure, and simple simulations show that between-sample relationships can be preserved and remain significant even when a large proportion of species is randomly removed from data sets. © 2009 The Paleontological Society.

This study explores survivorship of brachiopods, a highly diverse and abundant Paleozoic clade, through the mid-Permian to mid-Triassic interval, which includes the greatest mass extinction in the history of metazoan life. This interval of time separates two of the major Phanerozoic evolutionary faunas. In this regard, survivorship across any one extinction during the interval would not have been relevant if the survivor went extinct shortly after the extinction event; surviving background extinction is as important as surviving a mass extinction. Similarly, taxa that survived but failed to rediversify also were not major elements of the Mesozoic evolutionary fauna. Thus, the analysis aims to analyze survivorship not just across a single extinction but across the entire mid-Permian to mid-Triassic; only survivors through the entire interval can be the ancestors of the Mesozoic clades. Fewer brachiopod genera survived the interval than did brachiopod clades, suggesting that pseudoextinction or insufficient sampling could be a problem in analyzing these extinctions; thus, survivorship analysis should be conducted at the clade level. Nine characteristics were examined for generic representatives of 20 North American brachiopod clades, five of which survived both Permian extinctions and the subsequent earliest Triassic transitional interval. Characteristics include both those that operate on global scales and those that operate on the higher-resolution scales of individuals and populations. Survivors were significantly smaller and occurred less frequently than victims. Mean diversity of communities in which survivors were present was significantly greater. The finding that rare taxa belonging to high-diversity communities were more likely to survive runs counter to traditional predictions. However, these results are consistent with recent studies suggesting that higher diversity within a trophic level may create a buffer, as surviving taxa quickly occupy the vacant niche space of the victims. As size, abundance, and community diversity are all statistically related, the small size of survivors may be an artifact of reduced biovolume per taxon in a diverse community. No significant relationship exists between global-scale processes and survivorship of brachiopods through the mid-Permian to mid-Triassic. The results suggest that ecological processes can strongly influence global extinction patterns. © 2008 The Paleontological Society.

Herein we calibrate ecological niche models to assess the climatic requirements of Laurus L. (Lauraceae), an emblematic relic from the Tethyan subtropical flora, subsequently using these models to infer how the range dynamics of Laurus were affected by Plio-Pleistocene climate changes. We also provide predictions of likely range changes resulting from future climatic scenarios. Location: The Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands (Canaries, Madeira, Azores). Methods: We used a maximum-entropy algorithm (Maxent)to model the relationship between climate and Laurus distribution over time. The models were fitted both to the present and to the middle Pliocene, based on fossil records. We employed climatic reconstructions for the mid-Pliocene (3 Ma), the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) and a CO2-doubling future scenario to project putative species distribution in each period. We validated the model projections with Laurus fossil and present occurrences. Results: Laurus preferentially occupied warm and moist areas with low seasonality, showing a marked stasis of its climatic niche. Models fitted to Pliocene conditions successfully predicted the current species distribution. Large suitable areas existed during the Pliocene, which were strongly reduced during the Pleistocene, but humid refugia within the Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands enabled long-term persistence. Future climate conditions are likely to re-open areas suitable for colonization north of the current range. Main conclusions: The climatic requirements of Laurus remained virtually unchanged over the last 3 Myr.

This species's relatively high drought tolerance might account for the survival of Laurus in continental Europe throughout the Quaternary whilst other Lauraceae became extinct.

As a complement to these approaches, carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of tooth enamel can provide insight into habitat and dietary preferences of herbivorous dinosaurs. This approach is based on the isotopic variability in plant material and in surface waters of the past, which is in turn reflected by carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of animals that ingested the organic matter or drank the water. Thus, it has the potential to identify and characterize dietary and habitat preferences for coexisting taxa. In this study, stable isotope ratios from coexisting hadrosaurian and ceratopsian dinosaurs of the Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota are compared for four different stratigraphic levels. Isotopic offsets between tooth enamel and tooth dentine, as well as taxonomic differences in means and in patterns of isotopic data among taxa, indicate that primary paleoecological information is preserved. The existence of taxonomic offsets also provides the first direct evidence for dietary niche partitioning among these herbivorous dinosaur taxa. Of particular interest is the observation that the nature of this partitioning changes over time: for some localities ceratopsian dinosaurs have higher carbon and oxygen isotope ratios than hadrosaurs, indicating a preference for plants living in open settings near the coast, whereas for other localities isotope ratios are lower, indicating a preference for plants in the understory of forests. In most cases the isotope ratios among hadrosaurs are similar and are interpreted to represent a dietary preference for plants of the forest canopy. The inferred differences in ceratopsian behavior are suggested to represent a change in vegetation cover and hence habitat availability in response to sea level change or to the position of river distributaries. Given our current lack of taxonomic resolution, it is not possible to determine if dietary and habitat preferences inferred from stable isotope data are associated with single, or multiple, species of hadrosaurian/ceratopsian dinosaurs. © 2008 The Paleontological Society.

By means of continuous monitoring of the microclimate conditions (temperature, relative humidity, water vapor density, wetness, and photosynthetically active radiation) inside and around the halite crusts, we demonstrate here that water vapor condenses within the pore space of the halite at relative humidity (RH) levels that otherwise hinder the occurrence of liquid water in the surrounding environment. Water condensation occurs at RH &gt;75%, which corresponds to the deliquescence point of halite. We have estimated a total of 57 deliquescence events (i.e., water condensation) within the halite crusts, as opposed to only 1 liquid water event outside. These wet events resulted in a total of 213.8 h of potential photosynthetic activity for the endolithic microorganisms versus only 6 h for organisms outside the halite crusts.

This dynamic implies that resources are more easily obtained by new species in high-diversity than in low-diversity ecosystems, a counterintuitive observation, particularly in light of apparent resistance of tropical habitats to invasion from high latitudes over both the short and the long term. Such a latitudinal trend in origination could be promoted by ecological feedbacks, such as proposed by advocates of niche construction (e.g., Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Erwin 2007), but the question of why there should be a gradient in feedbacks remains. The rapid diversity rebound in the New World Tropics following a late Neogene extinction pulse (see Todd et al. 2002; O'Dea et al. 2007) might have been partially fueled from higher latitudes, but the huge pool of tropical lineages available as diversification sources would have swamped the much smaller number of potential extratropical invaders. Combined molecular and paleontological analyses are needed to assess biogeographic sources of the marine Neotropical evolutionary rebound. Adaptations to the high-latitude environment, whether biotic, physical, or both combined, seem to result in the suppression of per-taxon origination relative to lower latitudes. This would explain the progressive failure of generic lineages to penetrate into increasingly higher latitudes where ecological generalists are most successful and are incumbent. Indeed, such preemptive interactions may be a significant factor in molding the LDG to the gradient of those diversity-dependent environmental conditions that correlate with latitude. The role played by extinction in the dynamics of the LDG would thus be to reduce the incumbent fauna sufficiently below its carrying capacity to provide ""openings"" for the invasion of new species (Walker and Valentine 1984), some of which would add genera to the region. If a polar extinction spike could be found, our hypothesis might be tested by whether there was a compensatory replacement of lost genera from the temperate biota. At any rate, the lack of any clear difference between temperate and polar extinction rates accords well with the dynamic outlined above. There is no evidence in the data reported here that the extinction rate directly affects carrying capacity or is the primary control on the LDG, although it may push diversity below regional carrying capacity and thus drive temporal or spatial divergence from an idealized trend. The hypothesis we develop here thus goes counter to classic suggestions that equatorward range limits are set by biotic interactions and poleward limits are set by physical factors (e.g., Dobzhansky 1950; MacArthur 1972). Instead, we suggest that physical environmental factors determine regional differences in the niche breadth of taxa throughout the LDG, with resulting variations in biotic resistance to invasion and local origination. The LDG, and by implication other large-scale spatial variations in diversity, is thus primarily an evolutionary rather than an ecological phenomenon, albeit, as in most evolutionary cases, driven by adaptations to ecological conditions. We suggest that marine latitudinal gradients in diversity-dependent ecological factors produce an OTT dynamic, with a low-latitude source and higher-latitude filters, where the filtering processes are mediated by the incumbency of local populations that belong on average to progressively older and ecologically more generalized lineages at progressively higher latitudes. Moreover, the role of biotic interactions as proximate factors in structuring spatial and temporal diversity patterns will be severely underestimated if, as proposed here, the nature of those interactions varies with physical environmental parameters. Diversity-dependent factors do not only come into play at the high end of the diversity scale. Depending on regional history and environmental context, we suspect that biotas at any diversity level can be at, or distant from, a state in which diversity dependence is a significant force. © 2008 The Paleontological Society.

Without the potential incentives given by the CDM, CCS in developing countries will only take place sporadically in niche sectors. The debate around CCS in the CDM has developed into a highly polarised discussion, with a deep divide between proponents and opponents and no view on reconciliation between the various perspectives. Environmental organisations and several developing-country parties in the climate negotiations are increasingly vehemently opposed against CCS in the CDM, and industrialised countries, several large fossil-fuel-dependent developing countries and industry view CCS as a natural option under the CDM, provided some surmountable technical and procedural barriers are taken care of. This paper argues that the efforts of those trying to bring the discussion to a close by solving technical and procedural issues around CCS in the CDM will not lead to agreement because of underlying convictions of all stakeholders. Six convictions are identified and discussed. Based on the discussion of the convictions of both opponents and proponents, research needs and a potential negotiation package are suggested. The research needs are primarily in the field of the CDM market impacts of CCS, the issue of enhanced oil emission accounting, and sustainable development aspects, and particularly whether developing countries could actually benefit from technological leadership in the field of CCS, or whether they will be worse off. Devoting attention to the identified convictions could provide information for a more acceptable negotiation package on CCS in the CDM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Mineralized filaments are found in carbonate amygdules (vesicles filled by carbonate cement) in the volcanic rock, where they started to form on the internal surface of the once water-filled vesicles. Biogenicity of the filaments is indicated by (1) their size and shape resembling modern microorganisms including a constant diameter along the length of curved filaments, (2) their independence of crystal faces or cleavage planes, (3) branching patterns reminiscent of modern microorganisms, and (4) their spatial clustering and preferential occurrence close to the margin of pillows and in the inter-pillow breccias. A time lag between the deposition of pillow basalt and the activity of endoliths is revealed by the sequence of carbonate cements filling the amygdules. The putative filamentous microorganisms thrived after the formation of early fibrous rim cement, but before later equant calcite spar filled most of the remaining porosity. Microbial clay authigenesis analogous to the encrustation of prokaryotes in modern iron-rich environments led to the preservation of filaments.

The filamentous structures are ∼5 μm thick and ∼100-200 μm in length. They are found attached to phillipsite surfaces in veins and entombed in vein-filling carbonates. The carbon content of the filaments ranges between ∼10 wt% C and 55 wt% C. They further bind to propidium iodide (PI), which is a dye that binds to damaged cell membranes and remnants of DNA. Carbon-rich globular microstructures, 1-2 μm in diameter, are also found associated with the phillipsite surfaces as well as within wedge-shaped cavities in phillipsite assemblages. The globules have a carbon content that range between ∼5 wt% C and 55 wt% C and they bind to PI. Ordinary globular iron oxides found throughout the samples differ in that they contain no carbon and do not bind to the dye PI. The carbon-rich globules are mostly concentrated to a film-like structure that is attached to the phillipsite surfaces. This film has a carbon content that ranges between ∼25 wt% C and 75 wt% C and partially binds to PI. EDS analyses show that the carbon in all structures described are not associated with calcium and therefore not bound in carbonates. The carbon content and the binding to PI may indicate that the filamentous structures could represent fossilized filamentous microorganisms, the globules could represent fossilized microbial cells and the film-like structures could represent a microbially produced biofilm.

Both the ENMs were tested for present-day conditions, then used to hindcast ranges at the last glacial maximum (LGM) ca 21kyr ago, employing climate model data.

Interregional floristic differences challenge such reconstructions, because with widening spatial extent each pollen type represents an increasing number of species, each with its unique niche, thus blurring pollen-climate relationships. We conduct a series of cross-validation experiments in which we first explore (1) whether increasing the spatial extent of the pool of potential analogs improves or worsens MAT skill, (2) whether MAT skill is improved by increasing the number of pollen taxa and splitting pollen taxa into regional groups, and (3) the differences in MAT skill among environmental variables. Regional splits are guided by the range boundaries of parent species. Results are analyzed for multiple environmental variables. We then systematically explore options for (a) the value of the no-analog/analog threshold (T), (b) the maximum number of modern analogs (N) allowed for a target fossil sample, and (c) whether the environmental average constructed from the modern analogs should be weighted by their compositional dissimilarity (D) to the target sample. We demonstrate that substantial interregional differences in pollen-climate relationships, particularly between eastern and western North America, degrade MAT precision and accuracy, but these adverse effects can be overcome by expanding the list of taxa used and/or splitting pollen types into regional groups. MAT precision was best when pollen types were regionally split and better when more taxa were used, although increasing the taxon list from 64 to 135 types did not substantially increase performance. Temperature-related variables were reconstructed more precisely than hydrological variables, and there was little difference in MAT skill between climatic and bioclimatic variables (e.g. mean July temperatures versus growing degree days). T scales with the number of taxa analyzed, and there is a tradeoff between skill (best when T is low) and utility (if T is low, few samples can receive environmental inferences). For N, there is a tradeoff between precision and accuracy, such that retaining just the single best analog had the worst precision and best accuracy. Strongly weighting by taxonomic dissimilarity (1/D2) consistently reduced precision, but MAT precision was similar for unweighted and inverse-distance weighted averages. Given the above tradeoffs, we recommend using the 64-taxon list with taxa split by region, 0.20≤T≤0.30, 3≤N≤7, and either no weighting or an inverse-distance weighting, for North American applications of the MAT. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Location: Lakkasuo raised bog, southern Finland. Methods: Two radiometrically dated peat profiles were studied using high resolution plant macrofossil analysis. A combination of partial direct and indirect gradient analyses (CCA and DCA) was applied to quantify the role of different drivers of vegetation changes. Results: Autogenic hydroseral succession explained 16% of the compositional variation in the vegetation. Disturbance successions initiated by fire explained 15% of the variation in the hummock, but only 9% in the wetter lawn. The early post-disturbance successional stages were characterized by Eriophorum vaginatum. After partialling out the effects of peat depth and time since fire, a moisture gradient explained 29% of variation in the hummock core and 26% in the lawn. The analyses also indicated alternation between species with a similar niche. This interaction gradient explained 26% and 31% of the compositional variation in the hummock and lawn, respectively. The similar order of species replacement from both cores supported the existence of general directional succession in mire vegetation, both during the mire development and after fire events. The autogenic succession was slow and gradual while the disturbance successions were episodic and fast. Conclusion: Our results support the paradigm of the complex nature of mire vegetation dynamics where several interlinked agents have simultaneous effects.

However, the extent of such heritability in range size is disputed and the role of biology in shaping this attribute remains unclear. Here, we investigate the level of heritability of geographical range sizes that is generated from neutral models assuming no biological differences between species. Methods: We used three different neutral models, which differ in their speciation mode, to simulate the life-history of 250,000 individuals in a square lattice of 50 × 50 cells. These individuals can speciate, reproduce, migrate and die in the metacommunity according to stochastic events. We ran each model for 3000 steps and recorded the range size of each species at each step. The heritability of geographical range size was assessed using an asymmetry coefficient between range sizes of sister species and using the coefficient of correlation between the range sizes of ancestors and their descendants. Results: Our results demonstrated the ability of neutral models to mimic some important observed patterns in the heritability of geographical range size. Consistently, sister species exhibited higher asymmetry in range sizes than expected by chance, and correlations between the range sizes of ancestor-descendant species pairs, although often weak, were almost invariably positive. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that, even without any biological trait differences, statistically significant heritability in the geographical range sizes of species can be found. This heritability is weaker than that observed in some empirical studies, but suggests that even here a substantial component of heritability may not necessarily be associated with niche conservatism. We also conclude that both present-day and fossil data sets may provide similar information on the heritability of the geographical range sizes of species, while the omission of rare species will tend to overestimate this heritability. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Allopatric speciation; Gene flow; Metacommunity; Niche conservatism; Randomization tests; Species range size; Stochastic models,allopatry; fossil record; gene flow; heritability; life history; niche; numerical model; phylogenetics; range size; speciation (biology); stochasticity,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247154820,,FALSE,

The Aisemont Formation records a transgressive-regressive cycle. Prior to the crisis most of the colonial rugose corals were members of the Family Disphyllidae, but these were largely replaced by corals belonging to the Phillipsastraeidae. Among these Frechastraea colonized all environments of the basin and was the main constructor of a biostromal reef in its northern-most proximal area, in the fair-weather wave zone. Corals did not encrust each other and therefore were not firmly attached, but they hug tightly the substrate (a dead coral colony) and rest closely on it to resist to the turbulence of waves. During the Silurian and Devonian, up until the late Frasman crisis, shallow-water reefs in turbulent water were usually built by encrusting stromatoporoids, whereas rugose corals were restricted to waters of lower energy. Indeed, they were unable to encrust substrates, unlike stromatoporoids and post-Palaeozoic scleractinians, and to live in turbulent habitats. In Belgium argillaceous sedimentation prevented the development of stromatoporoids and provided an opportunity for the corals to colonize empty niches and to construct biostromes in relatively high-energy environments. At the same time Alveolites and stromatoporoids were dominant in a mid-proximal environment below the fair-weather wave base, but within the storm wave zone, where they also constructed biostromes. © The Geological Society of London.",,biostrome; Devonian; Frasnian; Paleozoic; shallow water; Silurian; transgression-regression cycle; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Western Europe; Anthozoa; Scleractinia; Stromatoporoida; Anthozoa; Scleractinia; Stromatoporoida,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247232694,,FALSE,

Distributed generation utilizing renewable energy resources offers opportunities for significant carbon dioxide and emissions reductions thus contributing solutions to broader climate change issues. Yet, renewable energy technologies like PV face various barriers for their widespread adoption. Aside from technical and cost issues, renewable technologies have to overcome the so-called carbon lock-in effects. This refers to the techno-institutional complex associated with the fossil-fuel based centralized generation regime that currently dominates energy production and use. Governmental interventions to address these issues usually can be seen as composed of research, development, demonstration and deployment or RD3 [PCAST, 1999. Panel on International Cooperation in Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment]. This paper focused on comparing the deployment aspect of PV technology in Japan and the USA. While both governments promoted PV as part of their larger strategies to address various environmental and energy security issues, Japan has built a PV installation capacity three times that of the USA as of December 2003 with over 90% of PV installation in the grid-connected small residential system category. This is in marked contrast to the case in the USA in which the cumulative installation is spilt among different types of applications involving the grid and off the grid. We put forward two models to explain these differences in deployment strategies and their possible consequences. The first deployment model leverages upon PV as a manufactured technology with minimal customization to achieve massive deployment. The second deployment model leverages upon PV as an information technology-like technology focusing upon user oriented customization to achieve deployment. Different models have different implications to the system engineering aspect of solar PV. A focus upon the standard grid-connected distributed category in the residential setting avoids the heavy customized engineering associated with many off-grid and one-off type projects. Japanese PV deployment strategy of concentrating upon a dominant category or niche with mass market potential also well matches the institutional structure of production [Coase, 1991. The Institutional Structure of Production, in Essays on Economics and Economists. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago] within the local PV technology suppliers industry. Major vertical integrated firms can facilitate system-related learning easier than a fragmented industry within the PV value chain with minimal transaction cost. This highly suggests that deployment strategy of PV or other renewable energy technologies must address the issues of adopting a globally developed technology to local (national) conditions and has strong institutional underpinnings in addition to financial subsidies, learning investment thinking. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from exceptional biotas (e.g. Chengjiang in S. China) and other fossil sites indicates a high level of biological interactivity (e.g. prey-predator relationships) and the colonization of a wide range of pelagic and benthic niches by predators, scavengers, detritus feeders and filter-feeders. A chain of biotic innovations and events seems to have played a crucial role in the construction of modern trophic webs: (1) the achievement of complex nervous systems, visual organs and motor functions; (2) the development of predation (e.g. by arthropods and infaunal worms); (3) the colonization of new niches (e.g. water column); and (4) the introduction of new tiers such as the mesozooplankton (e.g. chaetognaths, arthropods). All of them changed the dynamics of the ecosystem (energy flow, transfer of biomass, food source), introduced new selection pressures, triggered a cascade of adaptive behavioural and morphofunctional responses in the trophic layers, and catalysed biological diversification. The role of non-biological factors (e.g. oxygen, water chemistry, carbon cycle, climates) may have been important in the early stages of metazoan evolution and ecospace colonization, but these were probably negligible in the ecosystem build-up process itself. The early Cambrian global re-organization of the marine ecosystem resulted in more complex trophic links and stronger interactions between plankton and benthos. This unprecedented increase of interdependence between organisms, whose dynamics through the Precambrian -Cambrian transition still needs detailed explanation, made the marine ecosystems as a whole, and for the first time in their history, highly vulnerable to environmental perturbations such as climatic variations, changes in ocean chemistry and ultimately human action. © The Micropalaeontological Society 2007.",,biomass; biota; Cambrian; climate variation; colonization; environmental factor; marine ecosystem; niche; paleoceanography; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Precambrian; predator-prey interaction; trophic structure; Asia; Chengjiang; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yunnan; Arthropoda; Chaetognatha; Metazoa,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-38549136054,,FALSE,

Water column profiles of the Si and N isotopic composition of nutrients and the δ15 Ndiatom of sediment core tops support the use of δ30Si and δ 15 Ndiatom as tracers of silicic acid and nitrate utilization, but some issues remain concerning the use of these proxies for paleoceanographic reconstructions. If average marine δ30Si changes over time, it could contribute to the observed down core variations in δ30Si. Reconstruction of deepwater δ30Si using opal from sponges or deep-dwelling radiolarians would address this concern. Cleaning and measurement methods for δ15 Ndiatom need to be standardized between laboratories and in general suffer from our lack of knowledge of how much organic matter a clean diatom frustule should contain and what its C/N ratio should be. Corresponding shifts in the δ15N and C/N of diatom opal with species composition suggests that changes in species composition contributes to the measured down core variations in N and possibly Si as well. This could be due to changes in the ecological niche represented in the sediments or, in the case of N, to species specific fractionation factors. Separation of opal sediments into something more closely resembling monospecific samples is a key development that needs to be made and may be possible using laminar flow systems like ""split-flow lateral-transport thin fractionation"" (SPLITT).

Location: Emphasis is on biogeographical patterns in the Appalachian basin and mid-continent of North America during the Devonian. Global palaeobiogeographical patterns of the Cambrian are also considered. Methods: Palaeobiogeographical patterns are assessed within a GIS framework, including both direct range reconstruction and niche modelling methods, and within phylogenetic biogeographical analysis. Biogeographical patterns are considered within multiple clades of fossil invertebrates, including trilobites, crustaceans, brachiopods, and bivalves. Results: GIS-based analysis (including niche modelling methods) of Devonian invertebrates demonstrates a tightly correlated relationship between sea-level rises and range expansion, dispersal events, and species invasions. The predominance of range expansion and species invasions during the Late Devonian reduced opportunities for vicariant speciation during this interval. Comparison of phylogenetic biogeographical patterns between Cambrian and Devonian trilobites allows discernment of the relative roles of tectonics and eustacy in driving biogeographical patterns.

Many of these changes can be linked to increases in Paleolithic human population densities. Small game species are particularly diagnostic of increases in human hunting pressure and are a major source of evidence for demographic change after 40045,000 years ago. Biomass-corrected data on prey choice also indicate increasing use of those species that possess higher reproductive efficiencies. Step-wise, apparently irreversible shifts in human predatory niche are apparent in the Mediterranean Basin, beginning with the earliest Upper Paleolithic in the east and spreading westward. Evidence of demographic pressure and greater use of resilient prey populations is followed by technological innovations to exploit these animals more efficiently. The zooarchaeological findings suggest that Middle and Lower Paleolithic reproductive units probably were not robust at the micropopulation scale, due to the rather narrow set of behavioral responses that characterized social groups at the time, and thus localized extinctions at the micropopulation level were likely to have been common. Upper Paleolithic groups were the quintessential colonizers and, in addition, uniquely good at holding on to habitat gained. Upper Paleolithic archaeological ""cultures"" had shorter histories of existence than those of earlier periods, but they were even more widespread geographically. The demographic robustness of the Upper Paleolithic systems may stem from wholesale strategies for evening-out or sharing risk and volatility in technology. Micropopulations were larger and often denser on landscapes, more connected via cooperative ties, and thus more robust. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",Demography; Diet breadth; Foraging efficiency; Human evolution; Hunting; Mediterranean Paleolithic; Subsistence risk,archaeological evidence; demographic transition; foraging efficiency; human behavior; human evolution; hunting; Paleolithic; population density; population growth; predator-prey interaction; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750401425,,FALSE,

Location: The Western Hemisphere. Methods: We used digitized range maps of breeding birds to estimate the species richness at two grain sizes, 756 and 12,100 km2. We then used molecular phylogenies resolved to family to quantify the root distance (RD) of each species as a measure of its level of evolutionary development. Birds were classified as 'basal' or 'derived' based on the RD of their family, and richness patterns were contrasted for the most basal and most derived 30% of species. We also generated temperature estimates for the Palaeogene across the Western Hemisphere to examine how spatial covariation between past and present climates might make it difficult to distinguish between ecological and evolutionary hypotheses for the current richness gradient. Results: The warm, wet tropics support many species from basal bird clades, whereas the northern temperate zone and cool or dry tropics are dominated by species from more recent, evolutionarily derived clades. Furthermore, crucial to evaluating how niche conservatism among birds may drive the hemispherical richness gradient, the spatial structure of the richness gradient for basal groups is statistically indistinguishable from the overall gradient, whereas the richness gradient for derived groups is much shallower than the overall gradient. Finally, modern temperatures and the pattern of climate cooling since the Eocene are indistinguishable as predictors of bird species richness. Main conclusions: Differences in the richness gradients of basal vs. derived clades suggest that the hemispherical gradient has been strongly influenced by the differential extirpation of species in older, warm-adapted clades from parts of the world that have become cooler in the present. We propose that niche conservatism and global-scale climate change over evolutionary time provide a parsimonious explanation for the contemporary bird latitudinal diversity gradient in the New World, although dispersal limitation of some highly derived clades probably plays a secondary role. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Evolutionary time; Extinction; Latitudinal gradient; Mean root distance; New World birds; Palaeoclimate; Species; Species diversity,bird; breeding; climate change; Eocene; latitudinal gradient; nature conservation; species richness; Aves,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646015057,,FALSE,

However, before 7 Ma North American ecosystems were composed predominantly of C3 plants, complicating isotopic assessment of resource partitioning. Study of modern African and North American ecosystems has shown that niche partitioning among mammals may be discerned in communities dominated by C3 plants, suggesting that a similar approach may work for ancient C3 ecosystems. Here, such analyses are applied to explore resource use and niche partitioning in two ancient C3-dominated communities, one from California and one from Florida. Each locality, Black Hawk Ranch (California) and the Love Bone Bed (Florida), occurs in Miocene deposits that accumulated prior to the rapid increase in C4 ecosystems 7 Myr ago. δ13C and δ18O values were obtained from the tooth enamel of eight species from Black Hawk Ranch, and 15 species from the Love Bone Bed. Results from the 197 bulk isotope samples showed significant differences in δ13C among taxa at the Love Bone Bed, but no significant differences were observed among taxa at Black Hawk Ranch. At both localities, equids generally have more positive δ13C values than co-occurring taxa, suggesting that equids occupied more open habitats, whereas antilocaprids, camelids, and proboscideans have more negative values, implying utilization of more closed communities. One result of note is the positive δ13C values of Pediomeryx (Yumaceras) hamiltoni from the Love Bone Bed, which suggests that P. (Y.) hamiltoni incorporated abundant fiber, possibly grass, in the diet similar to the horses from this locality. The lack of significant differences among taxa at Black Hawk Ranch may indicate a relatively homogeneous flora, or presence of abundant resources permitting niche overlap, whereas the opposite is implied by the presence of significantly different isotope values among taxa at the Love Bone Bed. The results from this study highlight the utility of isotopic techniques allowing discernment of resource partitioning in C3-dominated landscapes such as those that persisted for the millions of years before the rapid increase in C4 ecosystems that occurred during the late Miocene. © 2006 The Paleontological Society.

Extensive operational use of the concept of natural selection may seem consistent with this argument. However, advances of evolutionary knowledge in independent fields such as phylogenetic analysis, developmental evolution, and paleontology cannot be ignored. I argue here that the role of natural selection in contemporary evolutionary biology can be compared to that of Newtonian mechanics in contemporary physics: it can describe a given domain of observations, but it is insufficient to handle the different sources of evolutionary knowledge. Overemphasis on natural selection as the immediate mechanism of evolution may lead to disregard phylogenetic-historical evidence, and to ignore the important evolutionary role of non-adaptive change and epigenetic phenotypic plasticity. Natural selection deals with populations and leads to conceive the environment as a ""sieve"" of genetic variation, bypassing the role of the environment as a trigger of phenotypic and behavioral diversification. Alternatively, it is possible to conceive how part of the medium participates as an ontogenic niche in the trans-reproductive change or conservation of an ontogenic phenotype. The concept of drift, currently accepted for molecular and developmental change, can be applied to the level of the phenotype as an alternative to the concept of evolution as adaptation by natural selection.",Development; Drift; Epigenesis; Evolution; History,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645104481,,FALSE,

This study aims to identify the life-history traits most likely to have influenced the current distribution pattern of this rain forest tree. 2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of reproductive failure. 3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing further favour relatively high levels of diversity (HE = 0.542) despite a small effective population size (Ne = 21.6). 4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted for by linking two important components of community assembly theory: dispersal and niche assembly. 5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa. Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances. 6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret species distribution and population structure are applicable across a broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response to changing circumstances and opportunities.

Hindcasting studies aim to emphasize among a large set of habitat variables those that are of interest for the focus species, whereas forecasting studies are intended to predict habitat selection according to a small number of habitat variables for a given area. We provide here a new analytical tool which relies on the concept of ecological niche, the K-select analysis, for hindcasting studies of habitat selection by animals using radio-tracking data. Each habitat variable defines one dimension in the ecological space. For each animal, the difference between the vector of average available habitat conditions and the vector of average used conditions defines the marginality vector. Its size is proportional to the importance of habitat selection, and its direction indicates which variables are selected. By performing a non-centered principal component analysis of the table containing the coordinates of the marginality vectors of each animal (row) on the habitat variables (column), the K-select analysis returns a linear combination of habitat variables for which the average marginality is greatest. It is a synthesis of variables which contributes the most to the habitat selection. As with principal component analysis, the biological significance of the factorial axes is deduced from the loading of variables. An example is provided: habitat selection by wild boar is studied in a Mediterranean habitat using the K-select analysis. The numerous advantages of the analysis (a large number of variables that can be included, individual variability in habitat selection taken into account, a lack of too strict underlying hypotheses) make it a powerful approach in radio-tracking studies designed to identify habitat variables that are selected by animals. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These bizarre forelimbs have aroused great curiosity as to the behavior of the animal, but until now no functional study on the forelimbs of Mononykus has been undertaken. Here I show that the orientation and range of motion in the forelimb elements of Mononykus are such that the humeri sprawl laterally, the antebrachia are held sub-vertically, the palms face ventrally, and intramanual movement is restricted to subparasagittal motion. This is a radical departure from the typical theropod condition, in which the palms face medially and intramanual movement is transverse. The results of this study confirm that the forelimbs of Mononykus could not have been used to grasp prey or dig burrows, but were well suited for scratch-digging or hook-and-pull movements such as are used by extant anteaters and pangolins to open tough insect nests. Mononykus likely occupied a niche equivalent to that of an anteater or pangolin, an unusual niche for a dinosaur. © 2005 The Paleontological Society.

Location: Tropical West Africa (Cameroon and Gabon), central Sahara (Chad) and East Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia). Methods: We employ three main approaches herein. First, we analyse the taxonomic diversity and distribution of larval Chironomidae in 12 regional study lakes using death assemblages of recently buried remains extracted from surface sediments. Secondly, we make taxonomic comparison with a similar analysis conducted in 73 East African lakes, and with checklists of Chironomidae species distribution in Africa. Thirdly, we present descriptions and illustrations of 21 West African morphotypes not previously encountered in surveys of East African Chironomidae based on subfossil larval remains. Results: This study involves 84 morphospecies or higher taxa, comprising 17 Tanypodinae, 14 Orthocladiinae, and 53 Chironominae (43 Chironomini; 10 Tanytarsini). As represented in our subfossil collections, the West African chironomid fauna shares at least 59 taxa (or 70.2% of faunal diversity) with the East African fauna, and a literature study also indicates that the majority of West African chironomid species are shared by the drier regions of North, East and Southern Africa. Freshwater lakes in tropical West Africa display a greater average taxon richness and diversity than freshwater lakes in East Africa, partly because Plio-Pleistocene climate variation in West Africa was more favourable to species survival and accumulation (promoting beta-diversity), and partly because current climatic and hydrological conditions in the region permit narrow niche differentiation and hence a more complex community structure (promoting alpha-diversity). Freshwater lakes in East Africa, especially those located in the semi-arid eastern Rift valleys of Kenya and Ethiopia, experience fluctuating hydrological regimes, which select for species able to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions.

To compare between taxa, we calculated an estimated bite force quotient (BFQ) as the residual of B S regressed on body mass. Estimated BS adjusted for body mass was higher for marsupials than placentals and the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) had the highest relative BS among extant taxa. The highest overall BS was in two extinct marsupial lions. BFQ in hyaenas were similar to those of related, non-osteophagous taxa challenging the common assumption that osteophagy necessitates extreme jaw muscle forces. High BFQ in living carnivores was associated with greater maximal prey size and hypercarnivory. For fossil taxa anatomically similar to living relatives, BFQ can be directly compared, and high values in the dire wolf (Canis dirus) and thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) suggest that they took relatively large prey. Direct inference may not be appropriate where morphologies depart widely from biomechanical models evident in living predators and must be considered together with evidence from other morphological indicators. Relatively low BFQ values in two extinct carnivores with morphologies not represented among extant species, the sabrecat, Smilodon fatalis, and marsupial sabretooth, Thylacosmilus atrox, support arguments that their killing techniques also differed from extant species and are consistent with 'canine-shear bite' and 'stabbing' models, respectively.

Current PV production cost ranges are presented, in terms of cost per peak W and cost per kWh, for single crystalline and multi-crystalline silicon, as well as for thin-film technologies. Possible decreases of these costs are assessed, as expected based on learning curves. The cumulative production needed to reach 'breakeven' (at which PV is competitive with conventional alternatives) is estimated for a range of values of the learning curve parameter. The cost of this cumulative production is calculated, and the question is posed whether and how the 'cost cap' can be bridged, the latter being the difference between what this cumulative production will cost and what it would cost if it could be produced at a currently competitive level. We also estimate how much PV could gain if external costs (due to environmental and health damage) of energy were internalised, for example by an energy tax. The conclusions are: (1) mainly due its high costs, PV electricity is unlikely to play a major role in global energy supply and carbon emissions abatement before 2020, (2) extrapolating past learning curves, one can expect its costs to decrease significantly, so that a considerable PV electricity share world-wide could materialise after 2020, (3) niche-market applications, e.g. using stand-alone systems in remote areas, are crucial for continuing ""the ride along the learning curve"", (4) damage costs of conventional (fossil) power sources are considerable, and they could provide an important part of the rationale behind major policy efforts to encourage increased use of PV. The costs involved with such policies would be elevated, but a considerable share of these costs could be justified by the fact that conventional power damage costs constitute a significant fraction of the cost gap, although probably not enough to close it. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Initially, the carbon-free technology has relatively high production costs, but niche markets ensure positive demand. Learning-by-doing decreases production costs, which increases the market share, which in turn accelerates learning-by-doing, and so forth. This mechanism allows a relatively modest carbon tax, of about 50 US$tC, to almost stabilise carbon emissions at their 2000 levels throughout the entire 21st century.

Sirenians first occur in Florida during the Eocene (ca. 40 Ma), have their peak diversity during the late Oligocene-Miocene (including the widespread dugongid Metaxytherium), and become virtually extinct by the late Miocene (ca. 8 Ma). Thereafter during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, sirenians are represented in Florida by abundant remains of fossil manatees (Trichechus sp.). Stable isotopic analyses were performed on 100 teeth of fossil sirenians and extant Trichechus manatus from Florida in order to reconstruct diets (as determined from δ13C values) and habitat preferences (as determined from δ18O values) and test previous hypotheses based on morphological characters and associated floral and faunal remains. A small sample (n = 6) of extant Dugong dugon from Australia was also analyzed as an extant model to interpret the ecology of fossil dugongs. A pilot study of captive manatees and their known diet revealed an isotopic enrichment (ε*) in δ13C of 14.0‰, indistinguishable from previously reported ε* for extant medium to large terrestrial mammalian herbivores with known diets. The variation in δ18OV-SMOW reported here is interpreted to indicate habitat preferences, with depleted tooth enamel values (≈25‰) representing freshwater rivers and springs, whereas enriched values (≈30‰.) indicate coastal marine environments. Taken together, the Eocene to late Miocene sirenians (Protosirenidae and Dugongidae) differ significantly in both δ13C and δ18O from Pleistocene and Recent manatees (Trichechidae). In general, Protosiren and the fossil dugongs from Florida have carbon isotopic values that are relatively positive (mean δ13C = -0.9‰) ranging from - 4.8‰ to 5.6‰, interpreted to represent a specialized diet of predominantly seagrasses. The oxygen isotopic values (mean δ18O = 29.2‰.) are likewise relatively positive, indicating a principally marine habitat preference. These interpretations correlate well with previous hypotheses based on morphology (e.g., degree of rostral deflection) and the known ecology of modern Dugong dugon from the Pacific Ocean. In contrast, the fossil and extant Trichechus teeth from Florida have relatively lower carbon isotopic values (mean δ13C = -7.2‰) that range from -18.2‰ to 1.7‰, interpreted as a more generalized diet ranging from C3 plants to seagrasses. The relatively lower oxygen isotopic values (mean δ18O = 28.1‰) are interpreted as a more diverse array of freshwater and marine habitat preferences than that of Protosiren and fossil dugongs. This study of Cenozoic sirenians from Florida further demonstrates that stable isotopes can test hypotheses previously based on morphology and associated floral and faunal remains. All these data sets taken together result in a more insightful approach to reconstructing the paleobiology of this interesting group of ancient aquatic mammalian herbivores. © 2004 The Paleontological Society.

The activities of past human populations have led to continuous alterations of the landscape, creating new ecological niches and habitats. Ethnohistorical and ethnographic documents have furnished some evidence for these activities. Plains Indians, for example, may have been responsible for deforestation in central North America (Wells 1970b). Similar forest destruction has been proposed for the Piedmont region in the southeastern United States. Here, Native Americans repeatedly burned off large portions of forestland to create grazing lands for deer populations (Hudson 1976:19). Additional sources suggest that burning forests and brush was a hunting technique used to concentrate game in one area for killing (Hudson 1976:19). Forest growth is further affected by cutting wood for fuel (Dimbleby 1978:53) and in the establishment of footpaths used for trading, hunting, and gathering (Ellen 1989:23). All of these human activities have altered the environment (Ellen 1989), but probably the most detrimental human behavior affecting the prehistoric southeastern United States was the process of clearing land for maize cultivation. Globally, the process of plant cultivation has led to enormou s changes in the s tru cture o f biotic associations. Field clearance alone has actuated the destruction of forests and native grasslands as well as other natural habitats (Ellen 1989:22-23). This paper examines the application of a small-mammal model to document prehistoric environmental change in the Black Belt physiographic region in Mississippi. The study's major emphasis is on documenting changes in small-mammal faunas in response to prehistoric agricultural clearing. To assess these changes, a small-mammal model is developed and applied to archaeological faunal assemblages recovered from the Black Belt region of east-central Mississippi and westcentral Alabama. Previous works by Scott (1982, 1983), where smallmammal data were used for environmental reconstruction, provide a basic framework for developing the model used in this study. Habitat preferences for small mammals indigenous to the study area are included in the model. The small-mammal model is then applied to assess possible environmental changes for two small Mississippianperiod (a.d. 1000-1540) sites located in the Black Prairie physiographic zone: the Josey Farm site (22OK793) (Rafferty and Hogue 1999) located just north of Starkville, and the Yarborough site (22CL814) located in nearby Clay County (Solis and Walling 1982). © 2003 by University of Alabama Press.

We find a significant and strong positive relationship between local and regional diversity, indicating that local communities were not saturated with species and that local processes did not exert a dominant influence on local diversity. Rather, local diversity was influenced more by regional oceanographic processes that governed the size of the regional species pool. This evidence for unsaturated communities is consistent with the Walker and Valentine hierarchically structured niche model of global diversification. These results come at the beginning of the 200-Myr Paleozoic plateau in both local and global diversity and therefore raise the question whether local communities were ever saturated with species during the Paleozoic.

The combination of these two approaches takes advantage of the strengths and overcome the weakness of both approaches. The range of δ13Ccollagen values for ungulate species indicates that C3 plants were dominant in the diet of these mammals. δ13Ccollagen values vary among ungulates: perissodactyls have the lowest values and bovids the highest ones, with cervids showing intermediate values. The hypsodonty index measured in lower molar teeth and the relative length of the lower premolar tooth row indicate that the horse, Equus altidens, was a grazing species, whereas the rhino, Stephanorhinus etruscus, was a mixed feeder in open habitats. The similar 13Ccollagen values shown in both perissodactyls does not reflect differences in feeding behavior with other ungulates, but rather a lower isotope enrichment factor in these monogastric herbivores than in ruminants, owing to their lower metabolic efficiency. The cervids Eucladoceros giulii and Dama sp. show low hypsodonty values, indicating that they were mixed feeders or browsers from forested habitats, an ecomorphologically based conclusion corroborated in the former by its low 15Ccollagen content (canopy effect). Bovid species (Bovini aff. Leptobos, Soergelia minor, and Hemitragus albus) presumably inhabited open environments, according to their comparatively high hypsodonty and 15Ccollagen values. Carnivore species (Homotherium latidens, Megantereon whitei, Pachycrocuta brevirostris, Canis falconeri, and Canis etruscus) exhibit higher 15Ccollagen values than ungulates. These results record the isotopic enrichment expected with an increase in trophic level and are also supported by low bone Sr.Zn ratios. The elevated 15Ccollagen value for a sample of Mammuthus meridionalis, which came from an individual with unfused epiphyses, confirms that it was a suckling animal. The 15Ccollagen value of the scimitar-cat H. latidens is well above that obtained for the young individual of Mammuthus, which indicates that juvenile elephants were an important part of its diet. The hippo, Hippopotamus antiquus, yielded unexpectedly high 18Chydroxyl values, which suggest feeding on aquatic, non-N2-fixing plants. The high 18Chydroxylvalues of bovids Hemitragus and Soergelia and of cervid Dama indicate that these ungulates obtained most of their water requirements from the vegetation. The megaherbivores and Eucladoceros exhibit the lowest 18Chydroxyl values, which suggest increased water dependence for them. Paleosynecological analysis was based on the relative abundance of species of large mammals from different ecological categories, determined by feeding behavior and locomotion types. The comparison of the frequencies of such categories in Venta Micena with those found in modern African communities indicates that the composition of the paleocommunity closely resembles those of savannas with tall grass and shrubs. The net above-ground primary productivity estimated for the on-crop biomass of the mammalian species preserved in the fossil assemblage also yields a figure congruent with that expected for an open environment. © 2003, The Paleontological Society.

Hypsodonty in mammals generally has been interpreted as a specialization into a grazing niche from a browsing niche. Here I examine the feeding strategy of the extinct hypsodont camel Hemiauchenia through an analysis of stable carbon isotope values from its tooth enamel, which was used to clarify its feeding strategy and to resolve conflicting interpretations of dental versus muzzle attributes. The paleodiet of Hemiauchenia is then used to test whether hypsodonty correlates to grazing within fossil Lamini. This study focuses on fossils from Florida, which is geographically ideal because unlike other regions of the country almost all extant plants on which animals browse use the C3 photosynthetic pathway. In contrast, most of the grasses and sedges utilized by grazers use the C4 photosynthetic pathway. If Hemiauchenia was an obligate grazer, the stable carbon isotope values of tooth enamel should reflect primarily a diet of C4 grass and sedge (&gt;-1.3‰). If Hemiauchenia was mainly a browser, the isotopic value should be considerably more negative reflecting ingestion primarily of C3 browse (&lt;-7.9‰). The mean δ13C values for Hemiauchenia during each time interval average more negative than -8.0‰, indicating a dominantly C3 browse diet, and there is no evidence for abandonment of the browsing niche from the Hemphillian through the Rancholabrean North American Land Mammal Ages. However, an increase in the range of isotopic values indicates a diet with a higher proportion of C4 grasses and sedges through time.

Location The geographical focus is the eastern flank of the tropical Andes, with particular reference to Peru. Method The article presents a synthetic review of the problem. Results Species-rich communities of the eastern Andean flank are threatened both by development and climate change. If, as predicted, the cloudbase and frost line lifts 600 m elevation this century, there will be a substantial loss of cloud forest habitat. Palaeoecology provides insights on the location and nature of past ecotones, the continuity of niche availability, and estimates for rates and modes of migration. With further warming and drying of lower montane regions, upslope migration of species will be individualistic: a new equilibrium with the altered climate is unlikely to be attained. The zone of agriculture will move upslope faster than the migrating trees and so landscape conversion will negate the ability of some species to respond to the new conditions. Conservation of the lower reaches of modern cloud forest is advocated as a means to limit this foreseeable extinction event. Main Conclusions Climate change will induce changes in plant and animal communities. Human disturbance will invade climatically marginal agricultural lands at the pace of climate change. Rapid migratory response such as that witnessed at the onset of the Holocene may not be evident as climates warm, because Holocene climatic stability has reduced outlying upslope populations that may have served as expansion nuclei.

Stratigraphic calibration of the phylogenetic trees indicates that most of the pre-Silurian record can be inferred only through ghost ranges. Assessment of the available data suggests that this is due to a shift in ecological niches after the latest Ordovician extinction event and a broadening of geographical range following the amalgamation of Euramerica during the early Silurian. Two major patterns are apparent in the biogeographic data. Firstly, the majority of jawless fishes with dermoskeletal, plated 'armour' were highly endemic during Cambrian-Ordovician time, with arandaspids restricted to Gondwana, galeaspids to China, and anatolepids, astraspids and, possibly, heterostracans confined to Laurentia. These Laurentian groups began to disperse to other continental blocks as the 'Old Red Sandstone continent' amalgamated through a series of tectonic collisions. The second major pattern, in contrast, encompasses a number of microsquamous and naked, jawed and jawless primitive vertebrates such as conodonts, thelodonts, placoderms, chondrichthyans and acanthodians, which dispersed rapidly and crossed oceanic barriers to attain cosmopolitan distributions, although many have Laurentian origins. A clear difference in dispersal potential exists between these two types of fishes. Overall, the development of biogeographic patterns in Early Palaeozoic vertebrates involved a complex interaction of dispersal, vicariance and tectonic convergence.",,adaptive radiation; paleobiogeography; Paleozoic; species diversity; vertebrate; Laurentia; Pisces; Vertebrata,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036042414,,FALSE,

Phylogeny indicates that the ancestor of the group first colonized Mauritius where speciation produced C. triserrata and the ancestor of the other species including a second sympatric Mauritian form, C. inepta.

'Saddlebacked' shells with high fronts evolved independently on all three islands.

This, coupled with a complex geological history, has attracted interest in the historical biogeography of the region. Two major models have been proposed. The vicariance model proposes that a proto-Antillean biota connecting North and South America in the late Cretaceous was fragmented by plate tectonic movement to form the current island biotas. The dispersal model suggests that organisms dispersed over water during the Cenozoic to reach the islands. A variation on the dispersal model proposes that a dry land bridge connected the Greater Antilles with South America for a short time during the mid-Cenozoic, facilitating dispersal into the Antilles. Most biogeographical studies addressing these models have been based on well-studied groups of vertebrates. Two lines of evidence suggest that dispersal, and not vicariance or a mid-Cenozoic dry land bridge, is responsible for the origin of most lineages studied. First, most West Indian groups are characteristically depauperate at the higher taxonomic levels, yet they often have some unusually large radiations of species. This taxonomic pattern, which is reflected in the fossil record, suggests that niches left vacant by groups absent from the Antilles have been filled by other groups present. Second, times of divergence estimated by molecular clocks indicate that most lineages arrived during the Cenozoic at times when there were no continental connections with the islands. These two lines of evidence are congruent with the nearly unidirectional current flow in the West Indies that probably brought flotsam from rivers in South America to these islands throughout the Cenozoic. Despite this general pattern, a few groups appear to have arrived very early and may represent ancient relicts of the proto-Antilles. The geological history and paleogeography of the West Indies is exceedingly complex and different authors have suggested different scenarios based on the same evidence. For this reason, it is too soon to exclude any particular model of Caribbean biogeography. The geological database and fossil record will continue to improve, phylogenetic relationships will become better known, and molecular divergence time estimates soon will be available for a wide diversity of taxa. Therefore, despite shortcomings of the current models, we can look forward, in the near future, to resolving many of these long unanswered questions of Caribbean biogeography. © 2001 by CRC Press LLC.",,,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049672681,,FALSE,

In the key wind energy regions, there is potential to develop a succession of large wind-farms of up to several hundreds of MW capacity. In the '90s the government target of 1 GW for the wind-power capacity to be installed by the year 2000 was lowered to 620 MW. In 1994, three government bodies, the then State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the State Economic and Trade Commission, created the long-term Development Programme for Renewable Energies for the years 1996-2010. In 1996, the new Electricity Law of the PRC, declared ""... the State encourages and supports electricity generation by using renewable and clean energy resources"". However, key energy objectives of China's Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000) reflected the continuing dominance of coal, oil and gas in China's energy policy-making. Between 1993 and 1997, wind generating capacity installed in China had risen from 17.1 to only 167 MW, while capital and operating costs for wind generated electricity (1998) were still too high in relation to coal and hydro generation. The 10th-Five Year Plan aims to promote more environment-friendly power generation including hydropower development in the western region. The plan will allocate more natural gas and renewable energy for power generation. With no value being ascribed to inherent cleanliness of wind energy, electricity produced from this relatively immature sector continues to need higher prices than that from entrenched, mature fossil-fuel-based power generation. In China this has contributed to a perception that wind is a niche-market resource, primarily relevant to remote rural areas which conventional power grids are not able to reach economically. Expansion of wind energy to a larger role runs into opposition from newly liberalised power networks who are more than ever concerned, and required, to keep the cost of supplies as low as possible. Within these limitations, some success has been and still is being achieved in buying down the costs through technical and scalar innovation in a growing number of grant-aided projects. For greater penetration to be achieved, a market needs to be created for wind energy. There is recent evidence in Europe and the United States that realistic incentives can encourage industry to consider much larger wind-power development projects with consequent improvement to the economics. Competitive bidding from wind-energy development companies can ensure that the targets are met at lower cost. A system of competitive bidding for licence areas (or concessions) for areas big enough to support very large wind-power plants, and chosen from prime wind regions by government, can be issued, regularly for bidding, as in oil and gas development. An accompanying institutional framework such as the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is essential. China is considering introducing a trial mandated market share (MMS) intervention, based on RPS for a selected region to assess its applicability to both China nationally and the renewable energy sector as a whole. There is a case for enactment of an encompassing Renewable Energy Law, which will provide a point focus for regulating renewable energy development, setting any RPS/MMS levels within time-frames and with all related modalities, including green certificate trading. An electricity price in the region of 4.5-5.0 USC/kWh will also need to be achieved when power purchase agreements are negotiated, if the bidding process is to achieve success. Local production of hardware needs to lower capital costs by an estimated 25-30% of current (2000) costs if economic returns are to be sufficient at these price levels. A concessionary approach, linked with a renewable portfolio standard law and aimed at large projects, can help achieve a faster development and a rapid buy-down of costs of wind energy technology. © 2001 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric power system economics; Energy policy; Energy resources; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Hydroelectric generators; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Wind power; Capital and operating costs; Fossil fuel-based power generation; Hydro-power development; Power purchase agreement; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy sector; Renewable portfolio standard; State economic and trade commissions; Electric power transmission networks,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549107358,,FALSE,

Previous studies have demonstrated a close relationship between the evolutionary appearance of algal photosymbiosis in planktonic foraminifera and evolutionary diversification of Paleogene photosymbiotic clades. For example, the evolution of photosymbiosis was synchronous with the abrupt evolution of four major groups of Paleogene planktonic foraminifera including two clades within the genus Morozovella, as well as the genera Acarinina and Igorina. Our new isotopic and biogeographic data suggest that the acarininids evolved from a photosymbiotic ancestor (which we identify as Praemurica inconstans or early representatives of Praemurica uncinata), but also demonstrate that photosymbiosis did not trigger an immediate species-level radiation in this group. Instead, the acarininids remained a low-diversity taxon restricted to high latitudes for nearly 1.8 million years before radiating ecologically and taxonomically. The eventual radiation of the acarininids is tied to an expansion of their geographic range into the mid and low latitudes. Biogeographic analyses of modern plankton suggest that high-latitude environments may be less conductive to establishing radiations simply because there are fewer niches avilable to be filled than there are in the tropics. Accordingly, the acarininids may have initially failed to diversify because they started off in environments that presented few opportunities to sustain a large radiation. The high-latitude origin of the acarininids continued to retard their overall diversification until they were able to develop strategies that allowed them to expand into tropical environments and fully exploit their photosymbiotic ecology. © 2001 The Paleontological Society.",,biogeography; biostratigraphy; isotopic composition; paleoenvironment; Paleogene; planktonic foraminifera; symbiosis; Indian Ocean; Acarinina; Foraminifera; Igorina; Morozovella,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034915841,,FALSE,

Ten faunal communities are recognised, based on the study and distribution of stromatoporoid and selected molluscan taxa, and the distribution of tabulate and rugose corals. The Burdikinia community, characterised by robust gastropods, occupied the coarse siliciclastic inner shelf. The Modiomorpha community is represented by a near-shore, in situ shell bed. The Stachyodes costulata-Syringopora community lived in inner shelf muddy carbonate-dominated lagoons, but was in part able to inhabit subtidal interstitial niches of marine headlands. In the Fletcherview-Burdekin Downs area, the Hermatostroma maculatum-Gerronostroma hendersoni community constructed lagoonal patch reefs, back-reef laminar stromatoporoid pavements and bioherms. The Clathrocoilona spissa-Aulopora community occupied nearshore, fringing biostromes in the Fanning River area. Ferestromatopora heideckeri-Amphipora ramosa-Stringocephalus community occupied extensive nearshore to offshore biostromes within the Fanning River-Golden Valley areas. The Coenostroma-Hermatostroma episcopale community dwelt within dispersed stromatoporoid pavements and less commonly, within offshore coralline thickets. The Amphipora pervesiculata community characterised by dendroid stromatoporoid-coralline thickets adjacent to and seaward of bioherms, dispersed stromatoporoid pavements and stromatoporoid biostromes, particularly in the Fletcherview-Burdekin Downs area. The Endophyllum community was restricted to patch reefs which grew during a regressive phase, carbonate to siliciclastic transition. A cephalopod association is represented by a sparse fauna occurring within deeper water micritic facies in the Golden Valley area. Analysis of stromatoporoid shape demonstrates the influence of both genetic and ecologic factors. Zonation of skeletal shape, apparent for both biostromal and biohermal complexes, indicates that strong ecologic influences dominated. Substrate type, sedimentation rate and water depth were important controls. Most taxa display a range of shape. Complex overgrowth phenomena, between stromatoporoid taxa, tabulate corals, chaetetids and algae produced compound skeletons that are most common within nearshore biostromes, and are interpreted to indicate stress imposed by repeated lethal depositional events or by seasonal variations in salinity. Intergrowths of stromatoporoids with tabulate corals Syringoporella? sp. and Syringopora sp., a number of rugose corals and a ?vermetid are documented. Syringoporella? sp. is more common in stromatoporoids with irregular skeletal architecture. For Syringoporella? sp. an even distribution of corallites within the host, skeletal response to corallite occurrence and the absence of micritic envelopes suggests a symbiotic relationship with both the coral and the stromatoporoid accreting at the same rate and maintaining an even growth surface. Six new species of stromatoporoids are described comprising Gerronostroma hendersoni, Trupetostroma zheni, Euryamphipora merlini, Ferestromatopora heideckeri, Coenostroma burdekinense and Coenostroma wyatti.

Ostracods observed in the laboratory were attracted to a wide spectrum of natural food sources, behaving as predators of living prey (e.g. polychaete annelids), as opportunistic scavengers on dead animals (e.g. annelids, fishes, squid), and also consuming artificial food. Food sources may be detected by chemoreception. The fourth limb (endopodites with strong sclerotized setae) and the furcal lamellae (claws with teeth) act in coordination to abrade and eventually tear open the protective integument of living/dead prey such as annelids. The mandibular palps are used mainly to hold the food. Food sections and soft-body contents are transferred to the mouth by the fourth limb (endopodial 'rake') and fifth limb (exopodite with pectinate setae) and are passed to the oesophagus by the endites (mandibles, fourth and fifth limbs). Food is subsequently pumped up to the stomach by peristaltic contractions of the oesophagus (ring muscles) and stored in the stomach pouch. The upper lip of bioluminescent (V. hilgendorfii) and nonbioluminescent species of Cypridinidae often contact food, suggesting that some of the glands housed in this organ may emit digestive enzymes prior to ingestion. Ostracods are able to ingest massive quantities of food within a few minutes and to survive starvation for several weeks. In V. hilgendorfii, the midgut is a huge saclike organ with no partition and is lined with a single layer of columnar epithelial cells. No differentiated hepatopancreas is present. The cypridinid produces a single faecal pellet wrapped in a thin reticulated, peritrophic membrane. Myodocopid ostracods exhibit a wide range of feeding strategies (detritus-feeding, comb-feeding, scavenging, predation, ectoparasitism) in both benthic and pelagic niches, and constitute a substantial source of food for many zooplankters. Adaptation of cypridinids to scavenging/predation is reflected in the morphology of their furcae, mandibles, fourth and fifth limbs, and their digestive system. Palaeontological data suggest that early Triassic cypridinids and possible late Ordovician myodocopids may have been carnivorous scavengers feeding on carcasses of cephalopods (ammonoids or orthoconic nautiloids), thus playing the same role of 'recyclers' as modern representatives of the group.",,crustacean; feeding behavior; functional morphology; Ostracoda; Vargula hilgendorfii,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031785923,,FALSE,

These data are used to interpret ancient diets and test previous hypotheses of terrestrial/aquatic adaptations of two sympatric rhinos, Aphelops and Teleoceras. The long-limbed, shorter-crowned Aphelops traditionally has been reconstructed as an open-country browser (similar to the modern black rhino), whereas short-limbed, higher-crowned Teleoceras traditionally has been reconstructed as an amphibious grazer (similar to the modern hippo). Between about 9. 5 and 7 Ma the δ13C values (all &lt;-11.0‰) from Florida Aphelops and Teleoceras indicate that both rhinos were feeding on C3 plants. This diet probably included a combination of browse and C3 grasses, although the exact proportions for each genus cannot be distinguished isotopically. In contrast, after the late Miocene global carbon shift as represented at 4.5 Ma in Florida, Aphelops was a browser (mean δ13C = -11.9‰), whereas Teleoceras was a mixed feeder/C4 grazer (mean δ13C = -7.0‰). Oxygen isotopic values indicate that neither Aphelops nor Teleoceras was principally aquatic.

Differences in mean species longevity between clades may have resulted from species sorting based on eurytopy (niche breadth). In order to test the relationship between longevity and eurytopy it was first necessary to recognize generalists (eurytopes) vs. specialists (stenotopes) objectively. Three different approaches were used: (1) the ""Eurytopy Index"" (EI), which is a measure of mean number of facies per species; (2) analysis of crinoid functional morphology; and (3) use of canonical discriminant analysis to analyze species distributions between facies in order to separate generalists from specialists. Mean species longevity for each clade was evaluated by four different approaches: (1) rarefaction was used to control for differences in sample size, including both species richness and number of occurrences, between clades; (2) potential facies control of species longevity was evaluated by a bootstrap that compared the observed data to a null model where species longevity was limited only by the actual occurrences of each species known facies through time; (3) uniformity of clade species richness through time was evaluated by the ""Index of Uniformity for Species Richness"" based on the standard deviation of clade species richness across the time intervals; and (4) potential species range truncations were evaluated by a biostratigraphic gap analysis based on the binomial distribution. The general order of increasing longevity and eurytopy is (from least to most): flexibles, advanced cladids, camerates, disparids, and primitive cladids. In general the pinnulate crinoids (advanced cladids and camerates) were specialists with lower mean species longevity, and the non-pinnulate crinoids (disparids and primitive cladids) were generalists with higher mean species longevity. Pinnulate crinoids were specialized for feeding in high-energy currents and, thus, were limited in their facies distribution and presumably more extinction-prone. The non-pinnulates could feed in both low- and high-energy currents and, thus, were less limited in their facies distribution and presumably less extinction-prone. The flexibles were the exception in that they were non-pinnulate but had the lowest mean species longevity, apparently because they were specialized for deeper-water clastic environments. On average, generalist clades have mean species longevities that at a minimum are up to 45% (≈1.0 ± 0.7 m.y.) longer than specialist clades. However, greater mean species longevity did not necessarily confer long-term advantages to a clade. The specialist advanced cladids became the dominant crinoid clade of the late Paleozoic and gave rise to the articulate crinoids of the post-Paleozoic. This may have resulted from the more rapid species turnover of stenotopes creating adaptive evolutionary novelties for their clade. Alternatively, it could simply be the result of stochastic processes. The finer subdivision of niche space by specialists has led previous workers to predict that specialist clades should have higher species richness than generalist clades.

Most of the biomass produced has alternative use as food, feed or fiber. In most cases, energy utilization of the biomass is far from competitive given today's prices. If dedicated energy crops are to be more competitive in the future, fossil energy prices must increase relative to the price of food, feed and fiber. Considerable spread exists among published future fossil fuel price forecasts. From currently available evidence, there is small hope that fossil energy prices will increase relative to the price of food and feed. The impact on the greenhouse gas balance is the most important positive factor for biomass energy, compared with fossil energy. For the time being there is no consensus among economists about the magnitude of the environmental costs of greenhouse gas emissions. Reasonable values on the external effects are in most cases not enough to make agriculture-based biomass energy competitive. Considerable government subsidies are needed. There is, however, no economic justification for such subsidies.

In order to characterize feeding ecology and niche differences, a suite of morphological characters was measured for each of 13 species of herbivorous mammals from the Pleistocene of Tarija; these were combined with carbon isotopic results from tooth enamel. (The Xenarthra were excluded from this study because they lack tooth enamel.) Several different bivariate and multivariate combinations of characters can be used to characterize the feeding adaptations, niches, and guild composition of the Tarija mammalian herbivores. During the Pleistocene the browsing guild in the Tarija basin is interpreted to include the tapir (Tapirus tarijensis), extinct llama (Palaeolama weddelli), peccary (Tayassu sp.), and deer (Hippocamelus sp.).

The rocky inselbergs and weathering covers connected with the development of active permafrost layer, as well as the commonness of block covers translocated graviationally on the slopes are the morphological results. They form zones of taluses and nival cones which constitute an important element of landscape. In the postglacial period, their development comprised many stages, evidence of this are morphological features and structure, particularly the presence of fossil tundra. Nowadays, intensive processes of falling off and active slope transport of waste are observed, which probably came into existence as a result of a cooling phase in the Little Ice Age. Chemical weathering is very active as shown by chemcial denudation indices, comparable with those charcteristic of areas with warm climates. Washing, piping and erosion connected with ablation and permafrost waters flow are responsible for the relief of edge zones built of loose sediments. The relief includes mainly cliffs of raised marine teraces and adjacent, slightly inclined, surfaces with frost structures. The differentiation and development rate of these processes and forms depend on many nival and solifluction processes which check erosion and direct the transformation of forms. In periglacial tundra and subnival areas, the most important processes are widely spread solifluction and frost segregation. The annual rate of solifluction (Tabl. II) is differentiated; this is a result of climate, lithological and morphological conditions and, above all, due to the state of humidity. Solifluction cooperates with the proceses of erosion and thermoerosion, nival phenomena (large accumulation of snow in the edge zones and patches of old snow), as well as the concentraiton and movement of waters in the active permafrost layer. This causes a diversity of terrace and tongue forms on the slopes of niches and synclines, and frost segregation on plateaux. Solifluction covers, often situated on the old abrasive platforms and marine sediments, are found on the slopes. The presence of hydrolaccolites (palsa and pingo hummocks) which are in different stages of development is associated with development of ground ice forms. Palsa hummocks developed on wet areas with peat vegetation and seasonal pools on plains as well as on alluvial fans and sandurs. Large pingo forms are however formed in valleys (Chamberlin, Dunder), in the vicinity of subpolar glaciers, from which waters reach deeper layers and then escape through permafrost to the surface. These pingo forms are of Greenlandic type. The pingo forms of the Makenzie type developed in the delta sediments due to permafrost migration. In present times, many pingo forms have been destroyed due to thermokarstic and thermoerosion processes. The thermokarstic processes commonly occur in the marginal glacier zones and in the ice-moraine ridges coming from the Little Ice Age and even earlier. Intensive thermokarstic process and their common occurrence in these zones, as well as the quick recesssion of glaciers may be an indication of transformation caused by the present warming up of the climate.",,"morphogenesis; morphogenetic processes; periglacial conditions; relief formation; Svalbard, Spitsbergen, Bellsund, Wedel Jarlsbergland",Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030319388,,FALSE,

The highly plastic morphology of the planktonic forminfera at the base of the Palaeocene appeared, most likely, as an adaptive response of functional morphology to the pelagic habitat of the species and its mode of life. The diversification episodes of Danian plankotonic foraminifera appear to correspond to times of reduced oceanic mixing, stratified water masses, recovery of the surface water productivity and a progressive expansion of the trophic-resource continuum, with periods of maximum diversity corresponding to widespread oceanic surface-water oligotrophic conditions. These suggest a parallel adaptive trend of feeding strategies caused by the changing availability of nutrients in the water column, with probable increasing reliance in symbiosis under low nutrient conditions later in the Danian. Guembelitria cretacea, one of the few Cretaceous survivors, has been recorded in northeastern Brazil up to the lower part of the P2 Zone. A triserially coiled planktonic morphotype, this species started to diversify immediately after the K/T transition. After only a few thousand years, in the earliest Danian, the first Tertiary taxa (the Guembelitria-Woodringina lineage) appered; these are microperforate non-spinose forms that were probably restricted to shallow epipelagic waters. There is a trend towards uncoiling of the triserial pattern by progressively changing the positioning of the aperture, without any detectable ecophenotypic preference at first. The first specimens of the Eoglobigerina-Pseudosubbotina, Eoglobigerina-Subbotina and Praemuarica lineages, cancellate spinose and non-spinose forms, also evolved in the Danian in a nearly coeval and parallel evolutionary trend from a probably ancestral Hedbergella stock.

The fossil record of foraminifer-algal symbiosis suggests that the appearance of this ecological association contributed to the radiation of Paleogene planktic foraminifera. Isotopic evidence shows that photosymbiosis evolved in synchrony with a major diversification of trochospiral planktic foraminifera about 3.5 m.y. after the end-Cretaceous extinction. In modern planktic foraminifera, photosymbiotic species tend to have more cosmopolitan distributions than asymbiotic foraminifera and a greater ability to with-stand periods of nutrient stress. The simultaneous taxonomic radiation and acquisition of photosymbiosis are evidence that the ecological strategy permitted Paleocene foraminifera to expand their niche in pelagic environments by diversifying into low-nutrient surface waters. A comparison of the species longevities of Neogene and Paleogene symbiotic clades suggests that photosymbiosis does not regulate the characteristic rate of taxonomic turnover in clades after they appear. Species longevities are much shorter in Paleocene and Eocene photosymbiotic morphospecies than they are among photosymbiotic Neogene clades; apparently photosymbiosis does not exert a significant control over long-term evolutionary rates. In addition, the absence of a characteristic morphology associated with photosymbiosis in Cenozoic planktic foraminifera suggests that morphology, as with rate of evolutionary turnover, is linked to symbiosis only because of common inheritance instead of a functional relationship. Although the coincidence between the acquisition of photosymbiosis and generic diversification does suggest a linkage between this ecology and the appearance of foraminiferal higher taxa, there is little indication at the present that symbioses control long-term morphological or ecological patterns within these groups after their appearance. Photosymbiosis, and other evolutionary innovations, may be more a catalyst for the differentiation of major groups than a predictable governor on evolutionary rates.",,algae; Foraminifera; algae; evolution; evolutionary radiation; faunal radiation; foraminifera; Palaeocene; palaeoecology; Palaeogene; photosymbiosis; species turnover; symbiosis,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030412155,,FALSE,

Autotrophs take it from solar radiation and heterotrophs take it from autotrophs. Energy captured slowly by photosynthesis is stored up, and as denser reservoirs of energy have come into being over the course of Earth's history, heterotrophs that could use more energy evolved to exploit them. Homo sapiens is such a heterotroph; indeed, the ability to use energy extra-somatically (outside the body) enables human beings to use far more energy than any other heterotroph that has ever evolved. The control of fire and the exploitation of fossil fuels have made it possible for Homo sapiens to release, in a short time, vast amounts of energy that accumulated long before the species appeared. By using extrasomatic energy to modify more and more of its environment to suit human needs, the human population effectively expanded its resource base so that for long periods it has exceeded contemporary requirements. This allowed an expansion of population similar to that of species introduced into extremely propitious new habitats, such as rabbits in Australia or Japanese beetles in the United States. The world's present population of over 5.5 billion is sustained and continues to grow through the use of extrasomatic energy. But the exhaustion of fossil fuels, which supply three quarters of this energy, is not far off, and no other energy source is abundant and cheap enough to take their place. A collapse of the earth's human population cannot be more than a few years away. If there are survivors, they will not be able to carry on the cultural traditions of civilization, which require abundant, cheap energy. It is unlikely, however, that the species itself can long persist without the energy whose exploitation is so much a part of its modus vivendi. The human species may be seen as having evolved in the service of entropy, and it cannot be expected to outlast the dense accumulations of energy that have helped define its niche. Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny, but when the history of life on Earth is seen in perspective, the evolution of Homo sapiens is merely a transient episode that acts to redress the planet's energy balance. © 1995 Human Sciences Press, Inc.",,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342594308,,FALSE,

These and other barriers must ultimately be addressed if any federal government decides to institute policies to help establish large-scale biomass energy markets.

Taxonomic selectivity can be used to infer phylogenetic inheritance of extinction-biasing traits. Selectivity patterns among higher taxa, such as between mammals and bivalves, are well documented. Selectivity patterns among lower taxa (genus, species) have great potential for understanding the dynamics underlying higher taxic turnover. Two echinoid data sets, of fossil and living taxa, indicate that species extinctions do not occur randomly within genera. Reverse rarefaction estimates of past species extinction rates assume random species extinction within higher taxa, so these widely cited extinction estimates may be inaccurate. Revised estimates based on a simulated curve imply that past species extinctions rates may be 6%-15% lower than previously cited. Possible causes for the observed selectivity patterns are discussed. These include nonrandom phylogenetic nesting of species with traits often cited as enhancing extinction vulnerability, into certain taxa. Such traits include low abundance, large body size, narrow niche breadth, and many others. Phylogenetic nesting of extinction-biasing traits at many taxonomic levels does not predict that a dichotomy of mass-background selectivity based on a few traits will occur. Instead, it predicts patterns of selectivity at many taxonomic levels, and at many spatio-temporal scales. © 1995, Paleontological Society.

One major drawback of nearly all these models is that they typically do not consider the subsurface vertical heat fluxes (e.g., the effect of deep ocean temperatures and circulation). We present results froman SDM developed in the late 1960's that includes the parameterized effects of subsurface heat fluxes, and then use these results to demonstrate the importance that deep ocean temperatures can have in determining the climatic state. In this SDM, the ratio of the surface short wave absorption to the surface conductive capacity emerges as a quantity that competes with the subsurface (e.g., deep ocean) temperature in determining surface temperatures. For land, the conductive capacity is small and short wave absorption plays an important role; however, for the ocean the conductive capacity is large and the subsurface (deep ocean) temperature is the dominant influence on the surface temperature for the time scale over which the model is valid. This SDM also includes several of the most important features absent in an EBM, namely, an explicit dependence on the intrinsic physical nature of the earth's surface, the mean poloidal motions in the atmosphere that lead to the climate zonation, and a representation of the hydrologic cycle. When deep ocean temperatures in the model are increased to levels suggested by geologic data for the Cretaceous, surface temperatures at mid to high latitudes become much warmer and the circulation of the atmosphere becomes much subdued, especially as indicated by eddy statistics.

Only among echinoids and crinoids is the fossil record sufficiently well documented and representative for the subsequent post-Palaeozoic history to be interpreted. From very low diversity in the early Triassic, both groups diversified rapidly in the mid-Triassic to an early Carnian peak. Several important Triassic clades became extinct in the mid-Carnian, followed by a second phase of diversification in the Norian and early Jurassic when the fundamental character of post-Triassic echinoderm faunas was established. Throughout their post-Palaeozoic history, diversity has increased through two evolutionary strategies: expansion into juvenile morphotypes through paedomorphosis, and the optimization of existing adult morphology. Post-Palaeozoic crinoids show few, if any, morphological innovations related to feeding and largely occupy niches similar to those inhabited by various Palaeozoic crinoids. Echinoids have experienced a number of major adaptive breakthroughs in feeding strategy following the first appearance of irregular echinoids. -from Author",,Cainozoic; cladistics; diversification; echinoderm; evolutionary strategy; Mesozoic; radiation,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025526462,,FALSE,

Dense forest of a tropical nature characterises the Early to early Middle Eocene and mammals show a high ratio of small to large ground-dwelling forms, a relatively high percentage of arboreal species, and adaptations to eating soft fruit and low fibre content leaves. By the early Late Eocene, many tropical taxa had been lost and the vegetation was characterised by reedmarsh and swamp with patches of woodland. In the latest Eocene an extensive, persistent reedmarsh developed. These changes were accompanied by extinctions of many earlier mammalian adaptive types, a reduction in arboreal species and an increase in large ground-dwelling forms, especially herbivores with specialisations for a high fibre diet. Late Palaeocene floras in S England indicate open and disturbed environments with limited forested areas, but mammalian communities are typical of closed forest vegetation.

The frequency distribution of species among the three higher taxonomic levels in the model is similar to that in living marine taxa which have good fossil records. Three mass extinction patterns were imposed on the model after species diversity had attained equilibrium (i.e., when speciation = background extinction): random; bloc (contiguous niches were cleared); and clade (all members of selected higher taxa were removed). Effects on the taxonomic profile varied with pattern. Four of the five historical mass extinctions resemble the effects of the random pattern.

Trace fossils suggest some Devonian scorpions were amphibious, while development of a pre-oral tube indicates they were adapted for feeding out of water. Morphology of Silurian forms implies they were aquatic, solid feeders. The presence of Silurian fungivorous microarthropods is indicated by Ludlow faecal pellets containing fungal hyphae. The terrestrial decomposer niche was occupied, and soils therefore in existence, by then. Constant humid microclimates created by early land plants were important in enabling land colonization by arthropods otherwise susceptible to desiccation. Mamayev's gravitational hypothesis provides an explanation for evolution of hexapody from uniramians clambering up and over early land plants.

Such studies of the Stichocorys and Lamprocyrtis lineages suggest that allopatric speciation as peripheral isolates is important. Sympatric speciation is also a possible mode of evolution in these lineages. Hybridization may play a role in the evolution of one subspecies and one species. Allopatrically evolved subspecies and species require some time to inhabit their maximum geographical range after evolving in an isolated and peripheral part of that “environment,” whereas the supposedly sympatrically evolved forms do not. Cooling trends and water mass reorganization may be related to the speciation events. Similar, but much less controlled, studies on a macroevolutionary scale (evolution above the species level, essentially the “family” level) suggest that there have been about half a dozen periods of major adaptive breakthroughs resulting in quantum, or macro, evolution. Global coolings and the initiations of “new” cold-water spheres and related water masses appear to have allowed these macroevolutionary steps during the Ordovician, Devonian-Carboniferous, Permian, and early Neogene.

The first step in community-paleoecological analysis is to reconstruct the paleocommunity or paleoecosystem. However there are severe methodological limitations to any inference drawn from the composition and structure of a fossil assemblage. These result from various taphonomic biases. These constraints upon reliability of a community-paleoecological analysis are the least severe in the case of Cenozoic (and possibly Cretaceous) tropical to subtropical, mollusk- dominated, subtidal, benthic communities. The basic assumption of community paleoecology is that communities or biocoenoses represent a distinct, real level of biotic organization achieved through ecological integration of and coevolution among the species. This assumption seems to be invalid for two reasons. (1) The actual degree of community integration is in general insufficient to induce any driving forces for a structural development as predicted by the system theory. (2) The concept of biological reality and distinctness of the community level of biotic organization implies assignment of a significant role to group selection. The assumption that ecological communities achieve with time an equilibrium state representing an optimum habitat partitioning among the component species is invalid, at least as a generalization. This idea is largely falsified and refuted by a variety of ecological studies. Ecological communities are then merely an epi- phenomenon of the overlap in distributional patterns of various organisms. There is no intrinsic, biotic mechanism inducing community dynamics in either ecological, or evolutionary time. In spite of this conclusion, the so-called “community approach” under favorable taphonomic conditions is among the most reliable methods of paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and the data on so-called “community evolution” are relevant to the problem of a relationship between actually realized niche patterns and their environmental framework. The latter problem can also be approached through analysis of longevity-frequency-distributions of chronospecies found living together in various habitats. A preliminary investigation may indicate that the precondition to optimization of niche dimensions through coevolution among ecologically related species was met in subtidal benthic habitats but not in pelagic ones. To account for a niche subdivision among planktonic organisms, one has therefore to invoke a stochastic pattern of speciation rather than revolutionary mechanisms. © 1979, Paleontological Society.

A regional thermal anticline, with a minimum age of 750 Ma, extends north from Ardgour to northern Ross-shire: it probably extends southwards under the eastern Dalradian. This thermal anticline is cut across and shifted westwards south of Monar by the Sgurr Beag slide, on which up to 25 km thrust movement is estimated. The Loch Eil Division lacks old isotopic ages; it appears to be structurally and metamorphically simpler than the Morar and Glenfinnan divisions and it also differs from them geochemically. The simplest explanation of these facts is that Loch Eil Division rests unconformably on the metamorphosed Glenfinnan Division. The Central Highland Group (including the Monadhliath Schists) is presumed to occupy the same tectono-stratigraphical niche as the Loch Eil Division. Grampian events (510-480 Ma) produced three thermal highs of sillimanite grade: one in the Monadhliaths, the second in the NE Grampians, and the third affecting E Sutherland. Throughout most of the area under consideration, Grampian age isograd surfaces appear to dip at low angles. © 1979 Scottish Academic Press Ltd.",,,Article,Final,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052379973,,FALSE,

The oldest macroboring biota is an abundant yet low diversity fauna in hardgrounds and reefs of Lower Cambrian age. Following the extinction of archaeocyathids at the end of the Lower Cambrian (and thus the demise of skeletal reefs until the Middle Ordovician), boring organisms appear to be restricted to submarine hardgrounds. With the development of skeletal reefs in the Middle Ordovician the macroboring fauna shows a rapid speciation and a dramatic increase in diversity. This same pattern occurs again in the Devonian. This record appears to represent refuge of the fauna in low stress, hardground environments when skeletal reefs were not present and radiation in the high stress environment of the reef when large skeletal metazoa were abundant and diverse. © 1978, Paleontological Society.
